Their teachers are deeply committed and dedicated to their work/the children, while still being super accessible to us parents. In addition to traditional classroom time, the unique ways that academics are taught here foster a real deep learning and in ways that the children love and make a whole lot of sense... math blocks centered around actually constructing a structure, astronomy under the stars, hands on farm work related back to the world at large, established entrepreneurs teaching economic blocks seniors...\nOur boys love Hawthorne Valley Waldorf School and so do we!",

The beers are amazing including the house made selections that you can take home. They have non alcoholic beers and cocktails too. The ambience is perfect and you can eat inside or out by the (quiet) street with a view of the Hudson River. Go!",

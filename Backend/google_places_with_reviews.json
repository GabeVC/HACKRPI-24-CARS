Find out the school bus never left school premises because of an incident on the bus so every student had to get off the bus til further notice! The school staff couldn't even give me this information when they sit in the office all day just pushing paper but couldn't show great concern for their students! They weren't even aware of the situation going on in the back of their school grounds! TRANSFERRING MY KIDS ASAP! This school don't care for no one but a check!

One of the reasons for seeking out a Catholic school was for the morals, and for a better school atmosphere. Me and my wife went to the open school night to see the school and get information. I met one of the 2 principles, so I asked him about if busses were available. I stressed the importance of being able to get transportation because my wife works and I am a disabled Veteran with severe back issues that required major surgery, but I still get severe chronic pain, and it is permanent damage. I told him I would not be able to drive them to school every day. He told me that they have had many kids from our area that take the bus. Me and my wife were told that to get the bus, you have to register for school and pay the initial tuition so they can put in a request to transportation for the need. I said, I can't really count on a loose promise like that, it's a matter of me not being able to drive the long distance every day due to my injury. He swore and promised up and down that all we had to do was pay the tuition, hold the spots before it was \"too late,\" and the busses would be worked out. So, I paid the tuition. When it started getting close to school starting, I called back and asked how to set up for the bus. They told me then, THERE ARE NO BUSSES FOR MY AREA, and that they didn't know what I was talking about with the busses. No one remembered a thing, even though every teacher in the area was nodding their heads and agreeing the whole time the principle talked to us. He told us that he was very sorry, DIDN'T KNOW WHO TOLD ME THAT, and that he will tell his staff to not say things like that anymore.I was told to call the school district I was in and work it out with them. Ichabod Crane told me that they never heard of that. Now I'm stuck driving 40 mins to the school and 40 mins back every day, when there isn't traffic. My pain levels have been insane, and this has caused many problems for me and my family. I did give 2 stars instead of 1 because there are some really nice teachers and the main office receptionist tried her best to help after that, so there definitely is some good people at this school. But I have no clue what that was about, but I feel scammed, and I seriously feel incredibly sad about that. I know of at least 1 other parent at the school that they did something like this too as well.",

If you take a look around you can see the kitchen and the cooks working right in front of you which is a nice touch.\n\nWe ordered the loaded nachos as an appetizer  and the birria tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas as our entree.\n\nI feel 20 dollars for nachos is a bit steep but everything else was reasonably priced.\n\nThe food was great but I wouldn't call it the best Mexican food I've ever had. I will say though I loved the enchiladas and if I came back here that would probably be my go to order.\n\nWe didn't order any drinks but they do have a bar you can sit at if this is your thing.\n\nIf I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely be stopping by.",

We were able to make reservations online fairly easily, but our table wasn't ready when we arrived, so we ate outside (reservations recommended for this seating too) instead of waiting 15 minutes or so. There was only one waiter, and we sat for almost 15 minutes without even a glass of water. He was nice when he came, but we spent a good portion of the evening trying to get his attention.\n\nWe tried the brie and goat cheese with bread ( toast points). It was warm but surprisingly sweet.  I think the goat was mixed with something like an apricot jelly,  which made a good spread.  The brie separately (it was laid in strips on top) was good but just a strange mix with the jelly concoction.\n\nOne of us had Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese served cold.  By the time it was heated and returned, the rest of us had almost finished eating.    It was surprisingly tasty.  My BBQ pulled pork sandwich was also very good - nice and tender. Another companion had shrimp and grits.  After recently vacationing in the southeast,  this was unimpressive. It really did not look like pictured in the online menu,  and he noted very little cheese and three shrimp.\n\nIt was fun eating outside.  It got pretty dark so it was difficult to read the check when it was time to go.  They were hesitant to turn on the lighting,  and I could see why.  When they did,  it changed the mood.  The LED lights were harsh,  and it felt like we were sitting in a refrigerated display.  Maybe some goofy white Christmas lights would suit better.  Overall,  we enjoyed our experience enough to return.",

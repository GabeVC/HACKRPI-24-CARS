            "It's sad that such a nice park is being misused by some of the residents of the city that it is in. Not to mention they cannot spend any money A major overhaul of the pool that i'm sure was beautiful in his day. I think the overlooks\nshould be cleared a little bit more but it is a nice place to sit and just relax.",
            "I grew up coming here to Prospect Park for playing football, basketball, Frisbee and to cookout. The park was shuttered for a while after a certain political party basically ruined the place of public enjoyment. The roads are and we're in bad shape. I was happy to see on a chance drive by a cpl years ago, the gates were open. I come here to photograph the city in various stages of weather, time as in day or night. The deer are a plenty at 2, 3, 4 a.m. I find it cathartic and peaceful. It was the land where Samuel and Ebenezer Wilson built there home and afforded their livestock to roam and graze. Yes that Samuel 'Uncle Sam' Wilson, whose meatpacking business shipped to United States Army during War of 1812. The troops started to say The US stamped for  United States property as \"Uncle Sam\".\nI do believe that The new Mayor will do the best to get the place in shape at some point. After years of indescribable idiocy from the political party that has   mismanaged everything they touch. So the new Mayor is one of unity and common sense. In that, I have confidence to see there will be improvement here. It will give the Residents of Troy, the park that The Wilson's intended for the public.",

            "Prospect Park in Troy, New York, is a historic and well-loved green space that offers a variety of amenities and a peaceful environment. Here\u2019s a review of the park:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Panoramic Views: One of the standout features of Prospect Park is its elevation, providing stunning panoramic views of the city of Troy and the Hudson River. It's a fantastic spot for sightseeing, especially at sunset, when the landscape is bathed in golden light.\n\n2. Variety of Recreational Facilities: The park offers a wide range of recreational amenities, including tennis courts, basketball courts, and playgrounds. There\u2019s also plenty of open space for picnicking, playing catch, or simply relaxing on the grass.\n\n3. Historical Significance: Prospect Park has a rich history, being one of the oldest parks in Troy. It was designed in part by Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape architect behind Central Park. The park\u2019s historical elements, like the beautiful stone pavilion and walking paths, add to its charm.\n\n4. Well-Maintained Gardens: The park features well-tended gardens, including a rose garden that blooms beautifully in the warmer months. These areas are perfect for a leisurely stroll or for simply enjoying the floral beauty.\n\n5. Community Events: Prospect Park often hosts community events, such as outdoor concerts and festivals, which draw locals and visitors alike. These events add a vibrant and communal feel to the park, making it a focal point for the community.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Limited Parking: Parking can be challenging, particularly during peak hours or events. The park\u2019s popularity means that finding a spot might require some patience, especially on weekends.\n\n2. Aging Infrastructure: While the park is generally well-kept, some areas, such as the playground equipment and certain paths, could use updates or repairs. The age of the park is evident in some of its infrastructure.\n\n3. Seasonal Maintenance Issues: During certain times of the year, particularly in the winter, some parts of the park may not be as well-maintained, with snow or ice making paths difficult to navigate. In the summer, the park\u2019s popularity can lead to occasional littering, though it\u2019s usually addressed promptly.\n\n4. Crowds During Events: While community events are a positive aspect of the park, they can also make it very crowded, which might detract from the peaceful experience some visitors seek.",
            "Park would be a lot nicer if the city took better care of it. A lot of the roads in the park are closed, because they're falling apart. The roads that are open are in bad shape. The bathrooms have been closed for years, because they are in bad shape. They did put a few port a potties next to the closed bathrooms. There is a new disc golf course, if you're into that, and over near the tennis courts, there's some newer workout equipment. There is a nice playground for the kids, and a small splash pad. Several grills and picnic tables throughout the park as well. The park is in a beautiful spot, and has a nice view of the city, but overall, needs a lot of work to make it nice again."

            "The city of Troy, NY, made a significant investment in the golf course a couple of years ago, which resulted in huge improvements. Golfers come from miles around to play. Every time my husband & I  walk to the park on nice days, it is always busy. There are picnic areas, tennis courts & an ice rink for the local hockey players. We also enjoy getting take out from the Park Pub which is renowned for its chicken wings as well as a ham & cheese on marble rye with wholegrain mustard sandwich called  The Half & Half which is a local favorite.",
            "Frear Park's lake view is a hidden gem in the heart of the city, offering a picturesque escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. This serene spot, nestled behind the somewhat dilapidated tennis court, is a haven for nature lovers and those seeking a moment of tranquility.\n\nThe centerpiece of this scenic haven is the glistening lake, which is home to a charming community of ducks that gracefully glide across its surface. Watching these ducks is a delight, and it adds a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. As the day winds down, the lake provides a front-row seat to a breathtaking sunset, casting a warm, golden hue over the water that's simply mesmerizing.\n\nFor those who prefer not to sit idly by, there are well-placed seats along the lake's edge, inviting visitors to relax and take in the view. You can also explore the tranquil surroundings with the walking trail that meanders around the lake. This trail offers a perfect opportunity to get some exercise and immerse yourself in the natural beauty of the park.\n\nWhile the adjacent tennis court may show signs of age, it doesn't detract from the beauty of the lake view. In fact, it adds a touch of nostalgia to the experience, reminding us of the park's history.\n\nIn conclusion, Frear Park's lake view is a sanctuary of calm and beauty, where you can escape the daily grind and reconnect with nature. Watching the ducks and witnessing the sunset here is a truly magical experience. Whether you're seeking solitude or a leisurely stroll, this place has something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination for anyone in search of natural beauty in the heart of the city.",
            "I try to visit Frear Park as often as I possibly can, the park is always clean and well maintained with beautiful views and freindly people throughout. I especially like the golf course were I visit with most all of the golfers and the people who walk the trails, such a wonderful gift to the people of Troy.",
            "This was a fun little course with plenty of nice views. The greens are very very tough. They are very hilly and unpredictable. You will enjoy this place",
            "Frear Park Golf Course is in beautiful shape and condition! Greens are running fast (holes 7&8), fairways are green and fluffy and tee boxes are well cut and defined! Good job Superintendent!"

Relatively small playground areas.\nA defining aspect of this playground is it's calisthenics gym. There are 7 different stations each meant to be done for a minute each. Great way to be active and it got the extra star for it's addition.",

Closer to the hospital there is a functional basketball court and some playground equipment but it's rarely used to my knowledge.  I think the main purpose of this \"park\" (more like a large patch of unused land Troy happen to mow every few weeks) is to provide shortcuts from Jacob Street to Peoples Ave without walking all the way down to 15th.\n\nThat said, this park is fairly well trafficked during daylight hours, I've never felt unsafe walking.\n\nBeman Park, and the surrounding neighborhood, is often the target of Troy Police initiatives dealing with RPI students, don't let this make you feel the park is anyway unsafe.",

There is a basketball court and a baseball field.  There is also a large Pavillion area with picnic tables that I believe can be rented.

I mean the park and playground are very nice with lots to do, but it's always very busy. And now for me with this latest situation of the 11yr old being taken, my message to other parents, Please Please watch your children and if you aren't going to be with them make sure they have a way to check in with you!!! It's not a 100% safe world out there and you have to always be on your guard, you just never know.  Stay safe to you all."

What made it special was the wonderfully seasoned and crunchy lemon chickpeas, the creamy cashew tzatziki dressing, and the texture of the garlic tempeh. While most meat replacements still have a way to go, in terms of hitting the spot, the way this tempeh was prepared made for a refreshingly layered and texture-rich bite.\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a",

The reason why it doesn't hit the juicy sweet spot is that I'm not desiring more.... Thumbs up for the semisweet aftertaste!\n\nUPDATE: I've returned to Stacks Espresso Bar twice since my first visit on Sunday. I've since tried their cortado, espresso with an equal amount of milk to reduce acidity, and a large cup of their house blend drip coffee, black, no sugar. The cortado was on point, it was only my second time having one. It was very mellow and flavorful. The house blend is my new favorite, right here in downtown Troy, a 15 minute walk from my place. The blend is nutty and smooth, as advertised, and has a slow-sip-worthy bittersweet aftertaste, which I love...",

            "Had a beautiful brunch here! The soup was so yummy. The crepes were excellently made. And the scones were delicious! You cannot go wrong with their tea selection either. We even bought some leaves to take home and it makes my work mornings so much better! Highly recommend!",
            "One of the best restaurant downtown troy area. Everything are perfect ambiance  my husband and i love outdoors. When we  are in this restaurant feels like we are in europe. This little old town bring so much beauty. Our waitress she is the best! Alexis.. u are amazing and friendly and most of all happy to served us\u2764\ufe0f",
            "The Whistling Kettle is one of my favorite places! Love coming here for a decadent brunch - the tea is delicious, and the afternoon tea with a savory crepe, a premium salad, and a fresh baked scone is just an incredible meal. It's also got lovely atmosphere, for both the indoor and outdoor dining options (though hornets do tend to come try to steal your food when eating outside).",
            "Ordered from here about a half hour ago. Opened up my to go box to find this\u2026.. how do you think it\u2019s okay to serve a \u201ccrepe\u201d like this??? Didn\u2019t know I ordered an open, half eaten looking crepe. So disappointed. Won\u2019t eat here or ever recommend this place again.",
            "The teas here are exquisite and there are so many flavors available! I love that they have these perfect sample size bags so you can try a bunch without committing to a huge bag. You've got to do their afternoon or breakfast tea service; there are so many options for courses and they're all delicious. You'll leave full and happy. Come stay eat chat and catch up with a friend and then choose some yummy teas to take home."

            "Went here with my partner for our anniversary dinner. Had a reservation but it wasn't too busy on a late Wednesday night. Restaurant was clean and modern. Restrooms were super spacious, private, and clean. Lights slightly dimmed but not too much. Our waitress was sweet and attentive without being over bearing. She had great knowledge of the menu and answered all our questions. The truffle potato appetizer was amazing! We both ordered the prime filet steak and it was cooked perfectly and had a great sauce. Lots of wine to choose from. Our table was in the middle but we could still see the kitchen and the cooks. This restaurant made our night out a special time! Would definitely come back here again!",
            "5 stars all around. Our server Payson was an absolute gem. Chef Paul explained several details about the restaurant for us and even gave me a tour! We sat at the chefs table and we enjoyed watching everyone hard at work in the kitchen while we enjoyed our dinner. I can\u2019t wait to experience the dessert room and have events in \u201cThe Gallery\u201d. The food was top notch. Our ribeye/ filet was cooked perfectly and the sides complimented them beautifully. I wish I had words to explain how delicious and beautiful the dessert was, but there isn\u2019t. It\u2019s easily in my top 5 favorite desserts I\u2019ve ever had in my lifetime. It was an experience in itself.\n\nScarlet Knife is an experience and I cannot wait to come back!",
            "My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at the beginning of the month. We had the option of sitting at the chef's table, which is an awesome experience to see how the chef and staff work behind the scenes.\n\nThe good was delicious and great portion sizes, we went home with leftovers! I love that the menu add wine pairings for food items, which is really fun to try.\nAppetizers: cheese board and oysters\nDinner: French onion short rib and grilled ribeye\n\nWe didn't check out the dessert room, but certainly had some dessert. The pistachio creme brulee and raspberry rose sorbet were a deliciously unique pairing.\n\nAt the end of our meal, we were approached by both the manager and chef (separately) about our experience which was really nice.\n\nWe will definitely come back!",

            "Was excited to give this place a try. I usually prefer to support local but never hurts to try new things. The workers are extremely friendly but the process is definitely slow since there's no intercom used. They want to give you a more personal experience. Price is more than DD but less than Starbucks in comparison. I got the XL 32 oz iced Paris Toast. It was too light and more dairy than coffee. I'll probably wait a little bit and give them another try. Update: I gave them another try and did the XL iced PB Mocha and the coffee just tastes off. To many good places in the area to try again.",

On my way to work and oh my goodness I am blown away at how good the hashbrowns and bacon Gouda sandwich were! The staff was SO nice too! I will definitely be returning!!",

The iced matcha is great but really sweetened for my taste (be specific on what you want in case the menu doesn\u2019t mention the details and be ready when you get to the window). It\u2019s refreshing to see that they know the difference cold brew and iced coffee! They also open super early (530!) which is much needed on that busy route! Download the app to make it easier and mention you\u2019d like to tip if you don\u2019t have the app and don\u2019t have cash! The owners have a great attitude and you can tell they love what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ll definitely be back!",
            "Well... Aroma Joe's food pretty much stinks.   I asked about the breakfast sandwich and was told all the food comes frozen and they just heat it up.   A sad sausage and egg on some kind of dense biscut and some soggy hashbrowns.  They appear to specialize more in drinks.  My companion had a Iced Coffee with cream and caramel and described it as \"not aweful.\" and the Bacon Gouda Tuscan Roll.   All for the low price of $18.50 or so....  I usually dislike being this negative but it really was pretty bad.  Feb 2024.  Staff was nice."

            "Small inside (Only 9-10 seats), with a couple of tables on the sidewalk, but the service and food was excellent. The lunch menu isn't large, and we wanted something different, so we ordered the chick pea salad and industrial eggplant sandwiches. The chick pea salad was surprisingly  delicious, and my eggplant was also impressively tasty. And then I realized our meals were vegan as well (we are not vegetarians). I cut the eggplant sandwich in half (which squished it a little) and took a picture so you can see the layers of flavor.\nThe fries were also very good. Very simple, like the frenchfries we would get decades ago. No coating. No processing, just fries good well.\nWe want to try their breakfast next time!\nAtmosphere was old fashioned and simple, but fun. Like a luncheonette from the 60's. Great music.",
            "I\u2019ve been to Naughters twice, and honestly, I\u2019m a little surprised by its high rating.\n\nIt\u2019s an adorable diner with charming interiors that have a vintage vibe. When you enter, you\u2019ll find a few tables and some bar seats. Due to the limited seating, depending on the day and time, you might encounter a wait.\n\nThe menu at Naughters is small. I\u2019ve tried their vegetable hash and the eggplant sandwich. The food was just okay, but it was nice to see the chefs cooking right in front of you in the open kitchen. The staff were quick, patient, and attentive. The coffee was also just okay.\n\nOne advantage this spot has is that it\u2019s open till 2:30 AM on Fridays and Saturdays, making it a potential go-to for a late-night bite after drinks.\n\nI felt like my experience was pretty average, and I probably wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to visit again.",

The burger here is really good as are the fries.  The tuna melt is great, wish it came with some more fresh lettuce or tomatoes.\n\nOriginal review:\nAmazing little spot in downtown troy.  Super cool vibes and great staff, the food is simple.  Sometimes have to wait a bit as its very small inside but usually things move fairly quickly.  Love the coffee refills too.  Homefries, egg, toast, bacon egg and cheese are all good\n\nCant wait to try the chopped cheese",

We missed it the first time because we didn\u2019t see a sign.\nWe will definitely be back to try their lunch and dinner menus.",

We ordered eggs and home fries others at the bar had the chopped cheese sandwich and the fresh toast sticks were HUGE ended up sharing with 3 friends. Fair prices and good food. I liked the old school bar stools and the staff were friendly and accommodating. Check them out for a bite to eat early or late!"

I was with a friend who had a walker, so that was tough for us, but we really wanted to try it out. Two young ladies helped us get into the building, as the doors we tried were locked. The room was cafeteria style and had flags hanging up around above us. The food, as usual at panera, was delicious and good portion. They had a pastry case filled with dessert. I tried the new lemonade and we both had sandwiches that had just been added to the menu. Nice space, we were able to sit and chat without being rushed. I thought the staff was friendly.",

The pickles on our burgers were the best part, as they were amazing. They said they had to seat us at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, which was kinda weird because the place was mostly empty the whole time we were there, but the bartender was incredibly sweet. I will say that it is very expensive. I got one mixed drink, my son had a root beer, and our two burgers and fries was $75 including the tip.",

Food is palatable, you don't feel like you're going to die from a salt overdose, and the staff are nice.\n\nOnly things to note are that you should definitely wait until at least 10 or so to get pizza because after that the food has been fresh cooked within the last 20 minutes or so (and because the frozen stuff they put out before that is...

I should not have to walk across the street in the freezing cold to get food that is just average.  Although it takes less time to walk across the street and back with food than it does to just pay for it at PRIME.  Really wish people cared about their product that they serve instead of force it upon ourselves unless you want to go somewhere else.  My recommendation to anyone even thinking about going to this school should really plan on NOT buying from PRIME, and if you need something fast then go to a vending machine because even a vending machine is better than this place.",

The food is always fresh and prime always has something interesting and new that people haven't heard of on the menu, DAILY! They serve breakfast and lunch.

I bought the Italian sandwich which is way overpriced ($13) & sounded great until I received it & there was some kind of salad dressing on it that tastes & looks like thousand island but the description only called it a Vinny which I assumed was vinaigrette. They also claim to make their own capicola which I was looking forward to for it to only be ham with no spice or heat to it at all. Ik everybody make cappi differently but that\u2019s not even hot ham which would be closer to cappi.

Mallo\u2019s is my absolute favorite spot for a quick bite, the staff are so nice and they always have really good music and ambiance. A lot of restaurants put 0 effort or flavor into their vegan menu options.. not Mallo\u2019s. You\u2019d think vegan food is their specialty because they have 2 absolutely phenomenal vegan sandwiches. The Veggie can be ordered with homemade cashew cheese sauce that is to die for, and the Cauli-Reuben is what dreams are made of (caramelized onion heaven). If you have room for it, try their homemade potato chips! I can\u2019t recommend Mallo\u2019s enough, it\u2019s 100% worth the trip to downtown troy!",
            "I\u2019m going to say it\u2026 Mallo\u2019s is my favorite restaurant in Troy, hands-down! I just went for the third time and I have been blown away with four different menu items. The quality is top-notch and the flavor combinations are delic! Tons of GF & veg options too.",
            "I am very picky about food, and the egg sandwich I had here was the best sandwich I ever had in my entire life. I chose sausage option. Forgive me for the bad photo, but trust me, you will not ever be disappointed here. The boss is pretty chill as well."

They have a wide variety of baked goods but their quiches and scones, both sweet and savory, are definitely the highlight. We had a mushroom leek gruyere scone which was hot and very mushroomy which was a plus. They have other baked goods like cinnamon buns and whoopie pies. They also have a wide variety of drinks. The service is friendly and they also have a wide variety of gluten free options, including the quiches.",

Walking in, the atmosphere is welcoming with calming vibes. I enjoyed all the plants around the seating areas. Seating consisted of a few larger tables (family/ friends style seating), and booths along the windows. Back right is a comfortable L-shaped bench including high tops and stools. From my understanding what is available for their baked goodies changes often, during my visit they had gluten-free cupcakes, wicked big cookies, quiches, scones, coffee, tea, homemade salads, and more. Everything I put my eyes on in my opinion looked delicious!\nI ordered a Chai Latte which I thought to be very good. If you want a chillax and a pretty quiet place to just enjoy a coffee, Chai,  breakfast goodies, or whatever else they have to offer for the day I highly advise checking out THE FIFTH TIER BAKING STUDIO. I will be returning in the near future.",

            "We've been here fairly consistently since they opened in Wynantskill (never visited Albany location prior).  I love their biscotti-not too dry that you have to dunk it and a nice variety of flavors.  If they have GF biscotti, I'm not aware as the ones I select are not.  I don't seem to have too many issues with them (gluten sensitive).  Scones are nice as well.  Again, not too dry nor too wet.  Soups-have had a few, 15 bean and Veg are my favorites!  Oh, and chili!  Coffee-I'm not a dark coffee fan so I tend to get lattes and theirs are good.  Harney and Sons teas.  GF brownie with ganache is very good, don't let the GF deter you!  I'm not a quiche fan but have had a few which I have liked.  Nice atmosphere with booths, tables and sofa seating.  Decor is comfortable with lots of plants.  Good sized single rest room (helpful with kids).  Parking out front limited but there's a lot in the back with outdoor seating.  Always friendly service!  Pics are of a quiche, scone and veg soup."

The store is small for its size but when you first walk in you get the heavenly scent of fresh baked food and the aroma is what really draws you in. If you like sweets and freshly made food this is the spot to try. Staff is very friendly. Food tastes amazing and my friend and I had a Bacon and Guacamole on a ciabatta and a croissant with turkey bacon and roasted peppers. I had a Cinnamon Crunch Waffle and it came with mini white chocolate chips and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

You can't just randomly put stuff in, you have to think about how the flavors and textures interact. So here's my recommendations.  Base 1 is spicy Thai noodles. They aren't really spicy but the texture is great. I always get cheddar cheese and hard boiled egg. The rest varies depending if you want soup (broth) or salad (spinach). The salad youd want more crunchy things like broccoli, chips, nuts. The soup would be softer things like corn, beans. They have dozens of ingredients, most at no extra cost and you can choose 5. Then of course choice of protein, or none. It's a large amount of food for the price and Its great, fresh and healthy! Excuse the photo lighting, it was taken in my car in the dark. Which, by the way the building looks so cool in the dark! Also recommend the various lemonade, fruit, iced coffee and tea drinks."

            "Just discovered this not so hidden gem in Troy. Clean, Fast and Friendly was my first impression. Then I took a bite of \"The G\"  (one of their roast beef sandwiches) and fell in love. Homemade chips, a great pickle and a fresh brewed ice tea with a shot of raspberry for $11 you'll never order anything else. Best part is the owner herself can be seen working in the back so you know there's love going into all she does. I'll be back.\n\nUpdate- I went back and had the same thing. Just as great. Third times the charm...",
            "Super cute place with high quality sandwiches. Did not feel like they were prepared to handle more than a line of two people though. Was one of five people inside/one of three people waiting for food when I arrived with a friend 15 minutes before it got crowded at 11:40am. My friend got her food at 11:50, but we had to check in twice before I got mine at 12:10. Just sandwiches. They also got the side wrong.\nGood food and vibe though! Will be back.",

We like to stop there in the morning for a coffee and delicious treats.  But the best part has to be the early nightlife and music. We went there for a 7:00 pm show and had no problem finding a close parking spot.  They had light fare and sweet treats as well as high-quality beverages, wine, canned beer, and locally brewed beer on tap.  The musicians were fantastic and played for a full two hours.  Our group had an absolute ball and will be returning with friends.  This is a can't-miss new gem for the city of Troy!",

Niek and Alana, skilled musicians in their own rights, are masters of this journey, connecting with the area's best musicians as well as tapping into the talents of their well curated, nation-wide music community. Beyond the doors of the modest exterior at 147 4th St, Troy, all who enter will encounter an environment filled with welcoming vibes and creative energy. Enjoy the vibrant artwork, the delicious beverages, and especially, the high-quality music, priced at a \"song!\" Collect your BFFs and head to MoJo\u2019s!",

The music lasted approximately 3 hours, from 7-10 pm & the cover was a mere $10 per person. The room is cozy & warm feeling, featuring beautiful art on the walls which is for sale. There is also an outdoor patio complete with shade umbrellas, seating, and a welcoming ambiance.

            "I absolutely adore Jacob Alejandro; it's one of my favorite coffee shops in Troy. I've enjoyed a variety of their delightful coffees, from my beloved Horchata Latte to their indulgent Chocolate Milk Cold Brew. Their inventive flavors, like the cheesecake cortado, and seasonal offerings keep me coming back for more. And their housemade pastries\u2014each one is a treat, from scones to cheese bread.\n\nThe ambience at Jacob Alejandro perfectly complements the experience, exuding class and elegance. I love the green accents and the attention to detail throughout the space. It's simply a vibe, and I also enjoy working from here every once in a while!",
            "Place is great for coffee. I got regular filter coffee all black and it tastes just like how I wanted. A little bitter. Cappuccino is well made and beautiful. Too bad we don\u2019t eat much pastry breakfast but they look great.\n\nWe come here because the ambiance is well designed and the leather couch. Luckily we got here super early and the window seats are open. The town is so cute and quiet for a weekend getaway.\n\nI can tell the owners put a lot of thought into this place with little touches. There are a lot of tasteful green color. My maybe future cafe would totally have their vibe.\n\nOverall a great place for your first cup to just chill and relax.",
            "It's definitely a vibe. Love coming here on a Saturday or Sunday and grabbing a toffee coffee cold brew and a passion fruit sweet bun. Tried the Andouille sausage bun and pleasantly surprised by the honey mustard taste and snappy sausage. Perfect place for a coffee date and just hanging out in general. Bonus caught the farmers market last week and this week River fest. This place can get busy but it's worth it.",
            "Jacob Alejandro is *the* perfect coffee spot. It\u2019s a very well thought out establishment. I love the unique curated flavors and that they don\u2019t use your typical flavor shots. I\u2019ve branched out and tried so many flavors in my coffee and was pleasantly surprised with every single one of them. Sure you can save a few dollars and get cheaper coffee other places. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. You get what you pay for and here you\u2019re getting the BEST. I\u2019d be totally fine if I never had coffee anywhere but here for the rest of my life. The pastries are delicious as well. And the staff is always friendly! It\u2019s not just coffee, it\u2019s an experience."

Wish they had more seating, but not much they can do about that. Also, tell them Fabulous Walrus sent you to get a discount.",

We did take out and had it delivered to our hotel via door dash so cannot comment on the atmosphere.\n\nI\u2019m aware this part is not so much the Kafe, but the whole order arrived a total mess with the contents all mixed together.\n\nThe first container of a smash burger club tasted awful with soggy bread, and with the soggy fries, overly salted. The chicken wings although presented like a soup since the blue cheese container must have fallen apart, were the highlight. The cannolis were 4 small pieces, nothing special.\n\nLooking at the location now and the comments more deeply it seems maybe they are known best for pizza.",

We wanted to try their fries and were disappointed to receive burnt, bland fries that we immediately threw out. We're hoping that this was just a fluke and will continue to order from here because the pizza is so good!\n\nOur new favorite go to place! Everything we got tasted amazing, especially their chicken tenders! We got it delivered and it showed up hot and even 10 minutes early. Definitely worth the buy.",

For 1 bagel with egg and cheese it\u2019s almost $7. We rarely go here anymore, which is a shame. I haven't seen any change after all the complaints on similar issues.",
            "I have never given a five star review. At most, a 4. I was saving my 5 for something out of this world and let me tell you, this is it!!!!! The best breakfast sandwich I have EVER had in my 29 years on this earth. I mean they say a photo says 1,000 words\u2026 just look how beautiful she is??!!!!?? I have no further comments on the subject\u2026Just trust me on this one, do yourself a favor and get there right now!!!!!! I mean seriously, why are you still reading this? If you\u2019re reading this beyond business hours then get your sleeping bag ready to camp outside so you can be the first customer when they open their heavenly doors at 6am. Every second you waste could be another second closer to a delectable party for your taste buds. Get going!!!!",
            "I tried ordering online but saw there were no soups and no way to order a soup.  I called the store and tried to explain and ask how to order soup through the online system.  I was cut off mid sentence being told \"you have to order online for pick up\"  Once I was finished being cut off I explained what I was trying to order and how it was not showing and asked if they had soups for the day.  She did provide the soups of the day and then \"stated I have no clue why you cant order soup online, place the rest of your order online and then come in and buy your soup\".  I said well that defeats doing your drive-thru pick up. She replied \"yeah I don't know what to tell you Human Resources handles it\".\n\nI decided against my better judgement to stop in the Cafe and pick up lunch anyways. Soup was lukewarm, it was chicken vegetable with rice and the rice was hard and undercooked! This is my third time getting their soup and all three times it was lukewarm!\n\nThis visit my Turkey Bacon & Avocado Sandwich was different than every other time I have ordered it.  The Turkey was like a cheap sliced deli turkey and not the carved turkey it normally is.\n\nIts extremely disappointing considering the prices are not cheap.",
            "Oh my word! So amazing! My two kids and I went here today for a little family date and it was PERFECT! They did have outside seating but we opted for indoors. EVERY SINGLE staff member was attentive, kind and hard working. Not once did I see them just sitting around. They were super kind to my kids and even swept up the mess we made WITH JOY . Like come on!\n\nI got a bbq chicken panini, a 24oz iced coffee.\nMy son had a plain bagel toasted with plain cream cheese, a smoothie and my daughter had a egg (they even seasoned it up for her!)\n\nOur total was like $28 for all of it and it is so worth it! The food is delicious fresh and high quality! Also you know where it's from ! (See the little nap picture!)\nWill definitely be going again with more friends and family!\n\nGreat job guys !!!"

            "My husband and I went on a Thursday morning and there were only a few other people there so it was very quick and friendly service. I had the chunky monkey latte (banana and mocha) and an everything bagel with plain cream cheese. My husband had an americano and the French piggie (croissant with bacon, ham, egg and cheese). Everything was delicious and both plates came with a couple slices of pineapple which was a nice surprise. There are a few different rooms to sit in and we chose the library room so I could read for an hour in the comfy chair. There was a \u201ctake one, leave one\u201d book shelf which was cute.\n\nI gave one less star because it is kind of dim and chilly, concrete floors, only 1 comfy chair vibes. Not super hygge. Despite that very small critique I will absolutely return to try more of their offerings and likely an espresso brownie. Yum!",

It made me buy another slice to-go. The ambience was great too, with paintings, warm wood-like furniture\u2026 it was awesome! I was very happy with the service.

I didn\u2019t have any alcoholic beverages but a couple in the group had bloody Mary\u2019s and said they were good. Overall very nice experience.",
            "This place has been around for so long and I believe I've only been once when it was very small. I went on 10/14 (holiday so a lot of people off work) and there was quite a bit of a wait (25-30 mins for 2) but it did not disappoint. I cannot remember waitresses name but she was great. The food was outstanding and the upgrade to the restaurant is beautiful. Definitely would go again.",
            "Take out. Omelet was literally filled with onions. I actually removed them and a picture next to a very large coffee cup just for scale. Why? No feta, scoop of pesto dumped on it, spongy home fries. $14.",
            "The meal was decent overall, but the pricing doesn't align with the quality of the food. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the food arrives lukewarm, and the home fries certainly don't taste or look homemade. It feels like the restaurant is cutting too many corners while still charging for an 'experience' that doesn't deliver.\n\nOn the bright side, the staff is warm and does their best to be attentive, though they seem stretched thin due to understaffing.\n\nOne major concern is the bee issue on the patio. It\u2019s disappointing that patrons are left to decide if they\u2019re willing to \"take the risk\" to dine outside. This situation reflects a lack of responsibility on the part of the restaurant, where simple accountability could vastly improve the customer experience.",
            "Caf\u00e9 Madison is the spot for a solid Sunday morning brunch! Despite the 30-minute wait (which was well worth it), the vibe was cozy and inviting. I went all out with the Cheesesteak Omelette and Eggs Benedict \u2014 and trust me, both dishes hit it out the park. The omelette was packed with tender steak and gooey cheese, cooked perfectly with every bite. The Eggs Benedict had the silkiest hollandaise, and that poached egg was chef\u2019s kiss!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a brunch spot that\u2019ll satisfy your soul and leave you thinking about breakfast all week, Caf\u00e9 Madison\u2019s where it\u2019s at. Pro tip: Get there early if you don\u2019t wanna wait, but if you do, just know it\u2019ll be worth every second. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83e\udd5a\ud83d\udcaf"

Initially, we were seated in the middle section of the restaurant, which lacked the ambiance and openness of the front and back areas, as it had no windows or natural light. However, our server graciously accommodated our request to move. We ordered the French toast with berries and eggs along with buttermilk pancakes with vegetarian sausage, both of which arrived promptly. The only drawback was the limited parking, as street parking can be challenging to find, especially on a busy Friday.",

When you walk in, it\u2019s so cozy and both the decor and everyone working is incredibly welcoming.\n\nThere is a great drinks menu and on the reverse side, a really interesting wine list. Then comes the hard part, choosing what to eat! We wanted to try everything but I guess we\u2019ll just have to return in the future. The pepper shrimp had great flavor (and a lot of heat) which the cassava puffs tempered. And they had a curried goat special which was unbelievable.

There were few in attendance on a random weekday.\nSeasonal Special: Croissant Beni  $17 (5/5) which had a poached egg on a croissant. Interestingly, the dish sat on top of the hollandaise sauce rather than it drizzled on top. I requested for the house fries to be cooked well-done and it was indeed delivered as such! The fries were seasoned well and had a superior crunch to them!\nBlueberry Buttermilk Pancakes $7 (4/5): I wish we had the ability to ask for a single stack because the 2 for $7 was way too much for us in a sitting.

Will check out their other locations to compare."

            "We\u2019re out of towners staying close, and were looking for a quick meal and a couple drinks. Vibe was good, wings were awesome (at least from a West Coast perspective). Bartender was friendly and pleasant.",
            "Been here a couple times. It's ghetto an they charge a cover fee ( For a bar type ) atmosphere after a certain time even when the bar is dead. Over priced drinks an food is straight garbage an will give you heartburn. Only two good things is the pool table and the back patio for when you wish to take a smoke break. Place is honestly a joke of a bar. They have four bouncer at all times for a 90% dead bar.",
            "I visited Cafe Hollywood on a Friday night and was surprised to find a $20 cover charge. So of course I left!\n\nThe next day, I returned for St. Patty's and the vibes were completely different\u2014I actually preferred being there during the day. They had some dope St. Patrick's Day deals, which was a plus.\n\nHowever, my experience was dampened by the fact that the bartender seemed to be stealing tips. I had intended to tip her anyway, but I noticed that she took the tip directly from my money on the very first round, which didn't sit right with me. As a result, I didn't tip for the rest of the time I was there.\n\nOverall, Cafe Hollywood offers classic pub fare in casual digs with a full bar and a patio. The drinks was decent, but the tipping situation left a sour taste in my mouth.",
            "The food was okay. We had lemon pepper honey which I  do not recommend. It smells like burnt beef gravy. The habanero pepper was better. The drinks were good. Cannot complain about the service. Many of the other customers were young af and rude. The restroom was clean but didn't have soap. I've come in one other time just to use the restroom, and then too they didn't have soap.",
            "Update: went back like I said I would. A waitress was rude to my spouse. I got really upset and went to confront her. The bouncer was polite and helped diffuse the situation.Despite this, I still like this place and have a good time when I go.  Most of the staff is cool.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nThis place is fire! The wings and fries I got were so good. I celebrated my bday here with my spouse and baby. So much fun. Music Poppin!  I ate and drank inside. Had my temp taken at the door. My waitress was bad azz and wearing masks. Beer kicking. I have decided I am gonna be a regular. I do have one question for the owner though...what happened to the Black Ghostbuster!?\ud83d\ude2d The art on the table is of old movies I love, but there is a Ghostbuster missing! Please add him!"

            "We live in VT and often drive through Albany when we travel. My daughter is on a grain/sugar/processed foods free healing protocol, so we thought we hit the jackpot when we found this place.  The first two times we went it was the middle of the day and kind of busy, so we dismissed the dirty tables, figuring the staff hadn\u2019t had time to get to them.  This time, we were driving through right at opening so we arrived just as they unlocked the doors.  Every single table was dirty. The trash area was disgusting.  The bathrooms hadn\u2019t been cleaned. We were the first customers!  I couldn\u2019t count the number of health code violations, and was too scared to peek inside the kitchen.  The food looked fresh and tasted good, so there\u2019s that, and the staff was friendly, attentive and efficient.  This had nothing to do with them, and everything to do with management and ownership.  The owners are clearly not paying attention and shouldn\u2019t own a restaurant- hopefully they either sell it or wise up before someone gets sick.  We won\u2019t be back unfortunately.",
            "Ordered online for pickup.  Decided to try the new steak bowl.  Steak was cooked so rare it was still cool and rubbery.  My bowl was missing the potatoes that should have been in it as well.  Some of the lettuce was black and disintegrating it had gone so bad.",
            "DO NOT GO TO THIS CORE LIFE. Worst experience ever. I have never been treated so bad at a restaurant in my entire life. I walked in at 7:30 with the intent to get a Steak Bacon & Blue salad (add corn) for my mom and a broth bowl for myself. I specifically decided to go to core life because I have a viral infection and always go to get a broth bowl when I\u2019m sick. My plan was to get a bowl with rice noodles, corn, carrots, scallions, shredded cheese ginger, a little bit of cucumber basil dressing, beef broth, steak and cilantro. I also have celiac disease, so am a frequent CoreLife customer, however I don\u2019t think I will be returning after this incident. When I walked in, everything was basically packed up. The two employees were extremely reluctant to help me, but I had checked online, on their door, and to make sure that nothing had been posted about them closing early because of the weather (it snowed today). Nowhere did it say they were closing early. The female employee just threw everything in my mom\u2019s salad; it looked terrible. She also scooped her dressing from the top of the dressing container, so it was all oil. (See attached images). When I told her what I wanted in my broth bowl, she refused to put ginger in my salad because she said she had nothing to cut it with (i know that\u2019s a lie, I get ginger at core life almost every time I go). I know they have the grater, but it was very clear she had already put it away. She also told me she didn\u2019t have beef broth and only had chicken broth. When she went to do the dressing, I got extremely annoyed; knowing that they only put oil in my moms dressing, and she used the to go container cups to put my dressing in, and put WAY more dressing than I asked for in my broth bowl. She didn\u2019t put the bacon in my mom\u2019s salad, so I reminded her, and she very rudely grabbed it and put the bacon on. At this point I was completely appalled. I said, \u201cthere\u2019s really no way you can put ginger on?\u201d (Since I\u2019m sick, that\u2019s really the only thing I wanted to make me feel better). She snapped back, \u201ci already told you no. I have nothing to cut it with. I just want to go home\u201d. I said, \u201cwell it\u2019s a shame you guys close in a half hour\u201d. She said \u201cNo- we\u2019re closed now\u201d. I said, \u201cwell, online and on the door it says you close at 8\u201d. She said \u201cwell we\u2019re closing early because of all this (pointing at the snow) you\u2019re too late\u201d  and threw my food in a bag. At this point I was too disgusted to even ask for the cilantro. I have never been so degraded by and treated terribly by staff in my entire life. I have worked in customer service since I was 16 years old, and NEVER would talk to a customer like that. Ever. No matter if they made me stay at work 20 minutes after closing (which has happened to me). When I got in the car I cried. All I wanted was a healthy broth bowl to make me feel better since I\u2019m sick, and from somewhere I felt safe eating at with my celiac disease. After I left I went to the store to purchase some ginger to put in my bowl, and when I got home to eat it, it wasn\u2019t even edible because of how much dressing she put in it. I had to take some dressing out and dilute it with my own chicken broth just to be able to eat my meal. I am so hurt I will never return.",
            "I got a large bowl of the teriyaki rice bowl with a side of potatos and Mac and cheese. The mac and cheese had no flavor of anything not even cheese, it was basically mush and undercooked because there were hard to chew pieces. I somehow got sweet potatoes and regular potatos on my side all I tasted was the flavor of the sweet potato. My bowl was okay but there was barley any rice and and huge amount of some type of seed. I also had paid extra for kimichi and avocado which there was barley any of the kimichi. I had also tipped so I am very disappointed",
            "I love CoreLife Eatery, especially the franchise in Albany on Wolf Rd. The Dinner staff I'd great and the food is always fresh. I highly recommend the Smoothies!"

            "My family walked in around 3:00PM on a Sunday. There was only 1 girl serving the entire restaurant from the bar to all tables! Although she was terribly busy, she maintained her professionalism. Especially she has kept being polite, nice, with a big smile all the time.\n\nFood was delicious. Especially its puffy pizza.",
            "Morgan was outstanding. She handled all the orders without fail appeared to carry out all the order seemlessly and even change the TV station to our liking. Kudos to her and her service.\nFood was outstanding. We ordered pizza,  nachos and salad. Very good place to eat",

( big chunks of buffalo chicken) I had it with the Parmesan dressing so good \ud83d\ude0b.",
            "6 of us enjoyed dinner here on Sunday evening before a nearby show. If you have an event in the area, this is a great option for a centrally located restaurant. And they are open Sundays, which was hard to find.\nEven without a reservation, we managed to get in. However, we were there early; I suspect a table might have been harder to get later on. Service was amazing! Drink refills without asking, servers checking in just the right amount, and overall great customer service.\nIt is a small pub, which means it gets loud. This was fine for us, but if you are looking for a quiet spot to have long conversations, this will not be the place you want.\nPub food and pizza seems to be their specialty. Boneless wings were very good; a medium sauce had just enough spice. Mozzarella sticks also good (great marinara!) and a decent amount of them too. The pizza was delicious! I snuck a piece of my hubby's pepperoni pizza and loved it! Homemade sauce, great crust, and a nice balance of sauce to cheese. Sandwiches we ordered were good, just not outstanding. If I go back before another show, I would honestly order some more apps and pizza (I was thinking about getting chicken tenders, but didn't. Bet they are great!).\nOverall, a solid choice if you are in the area for a show and looking for some great pub apps and pizza.",

My 3 older brothers frequently here a bit more than me, just because I spent a lot of time away Actuve Duty Navy. Thank you, everyone, that has worked here over the years .. quality hasn't diminished."

            "The food is average but the price is fantastic. I tried the mini hotdogs with the works. They were more like a chili dog than upstate NY meat sauce hot dog. The burger and fries were good. The rice pudding was homemade so, better than the store bought but not quite as good as Grandma's recipe. It's nice to see a little mom and pop place like this is still open. You can fill up without shelling out a lot of money.",

            "Not just a greasy spoon. It\u2019s not just an aesthetic. This place is the real deal. Why have one got dog when you can have two, why have two hot dogs when you can have four covered in meat sauce and mustard.  The little dogs are so cute and satisfying to eat. But don\u2019t miss the burger. It doesn\u2019t look like much but it\u2019s truly special. The fries are also perfect. Wish I could be a regular here",
            "As usual, it is standing room only here. Scott and his crew serve up mini hotdogs with meat sauce and other delicacies that will make your mouth water !\nIn my younger days, my brother and I could eat twenty hotdogs each at a sitting. Nowadays, five is my limit. I always grab five extra \"for later\" since five just isn't enough. One other strong point that keeps me coming back is that they serve RC cola and 7 up - two of my favorite soft drinks. Thanks again, Scott !"

It might have just been the time of day that we came which backed up our orders/causes these issues. However, i did feel felt the waitress we got was very good, as she always made sure to come by and refill our water cups."

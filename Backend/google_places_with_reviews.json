The menu is extensive: from hot dogs, hamburgers to meat loaf, meat balls & pasta. Breakfast is served all day. We shared a scrumptious Reuben & a lamb gyro. Both were stuffed & juicy and the best we\u2019ve eaten in a long while. Fries were hot & tasty. We shared a coconut pie that was darned good. There is parking on the street and in an adjacent lot.

I received a MASSIVE amount of attitude from the manager when I requested a refund. This place is a lost cause and that will be the last time I ever step foot in this building. Good luck to anyone who chances an order here!\n\nPrevious review: The Dunkin' that is inside this particular gas station was recently renovated and now shines with a very modern look. Unfortunately, the renovation could not do anything to save the store from the continual lack of decent customer service at this location.\n\nI update this review every couple years as I Will occasionally stop by this location while getting gas for my car, and unfortunately I have never been able to give this dunkin more than two stars. It seems that every single time I give this place a shot, they manage to make the experience very subpar in one way or another. It does not matter if it's busy or quiet, night or day, something gets messed up. Sometimes my drink order is wrong, sometimes my food order is wrong. Sometimes my food takes 15 minutes (not an exaggeration) to be completed, sometimes I don't get everything that I ordered. Sometimes there's just a complete lack of situational awareness in the staff and everybody looks like they are running around confused as to what job they should be doing. And sometimes, like today, the order sits on the counter as if it were an online order, Waiting to be picked up, when in reality the order is for a customer standing right in front of the counter, completely oblivious to the fact that their food is getting cold sitting there because the employee who made it did not bother to call the order out.\n\nThis is all with the understanding that during the morning hours especially Dunkin is a very busy place. I understand busy. Anybody who has read any of my other reviews would know that I  understand wait times due to busyness. I understand that when there are a slew of orders, it's going to take a while to get your food, and occasionally mistakes are going to be made. This goes beyond occasionally, and unfortunately in some cases goes beyond the hard work ethic of some of the staff, as you can clearly tell some of them just don't care and have no sense of urgency.\n\nWith that, I continue to rate this establishment one star. I hope that at some point the procedures here are refined and the experience improves, but for now the facelift on the interior is only a facade and nothing else has really changed.",

I dined here one morning during a beer tour of Central New York and I found much to like about this simple yet nice restaurant establishment.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the location because it is unique. Val\u2019s Diner is located inside a bus terminal, making it a popular option for travelers as they arrive from a bus excursion or right before they depart. I like how they have the bus schedule announcements right inside the restaurant. You can hear them on the speaker, which is perfect for those who want to grab a bite to eat but don\u2019t want to have to worry that they might miss their bus.\n\nNext, the atmosphere. It is a diner in every sense and it has that look one associates with this type of restaurant. The sky blue colored walls, checkered tile floors, and bar stools without back supports are just what you expect in a diner.  There isn\u2019t a ton of seating, but because it is part of a bus terminal, I can\u2019t imagine it ever gets extremely busy.\n\nI was here for breakfast and I ordered an omelet, toast, and home fries. The food was served relatively quickly and it tasted fresh and good. The jelly is served in packets and I added a dab to my toast along with a small amount of catsup on my fries. I finished the entire contents of my plate in a short time and left feeling satisfied.\n\nDiners are not as common as other types of restaurants, but they exude a certain charm and make a nice change of pace from the usual restaurant. Val\u2019s Diner is a cool place for breakfast or lunch and great for those who are traveling by bus and need something to eat. Even if you\u2019re not using the bus terminal, Val\u2019s Diner is a good place for a simple meal and I\u2019m glad I discovered this friendly diner here in Binghamton, New York.",

The portions may not be huge but they are decently sized and very rich so you'll likely be full anyway. So happy that this place exists. The muffins and cookies are delicious. We did order a cake there for our anniversary and everybody who ate it loved it. It was honestly a little bit dry but it was still very rich and delicious. Everyone was very impressed to know that it was vegan but the one thing that everybody did mention was that it was just a bit dry for their taste which I can totally agree with. I feel like if it was less dry it would have been a completely perfect cake for our anniversary party. Either way I love to support this place because the people are great, the food is mind-blowingly delicious and the desserts are very good most of the time. The coffee is also excellent..",

I would eat there again and be very specific with whoever is taking the order on how I want my food prepared. I took a slice of their chocolate cake home and it was the best. Give the River Bistro a try \u2026 you will enjoy the atmosphere and the food is above average which is terrific. LIVE LOVE LAUGH ALWAYS \u2026 \ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83d\udc99",

We got the spaghetti and fettuccine.\nI wanted to get the Fettuccine with the lobster tail but the server didn\u2019t seem too happy to be there so I didn\u2019t want to ask about market pricing.\nOverall, this review is more a remark at service. We paid 70 dollars for a server who never was even slightly friendly. We love going out to eat and would never punish someone (by giving less than 20%) for just having a bad day. But, it\u2019s a semi slow lunch shift and you seem like we\u2019re annoying you for ordering with no additional questions. Just not a welcoming table side environment for such a beautiful place. It\u2019s our first time here! But we all know service makes or breaks even the best of cuisine.",

RESERVATIONS were made and are highly recommended here.\n\nWe decided on Downtown for a special event after hearing of the recent renovations to make the Downtown Beer Tree location a little more upscale.  We were greeted at the door and immediately shown a table.\n\nOn this visit I opted for the special which was a steak topped with crumbly blue cheese and a side of  corn creme brulee. We also opted for an appetizer, crispy deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were excellent! I was a little reserved about this choice but those reservations quickly went away after the first bite, and I would highly recommend them. The steak was cooked to perfect temperature (I opt for mid-rare) and was packed with flavor. The corn creme brulee was another item that blew me away, I was not expecting it to be as delicious as it was. A great and well put together meal!\n\nAnother neat touch is you get to choose the knife you would like to use to cut your entree from a boxed selection. It adds a bit to the experience.\n\nDo keep in mind that this restaurant is now catering to a more upscale vibe, and with that comes upscale costs. Our trip, with two entrees, an appetizer and alcohol, put us back around $200.  This is not a restaurant that the average Joe is going to frequent often, but it does make for a wonderful experience for those special occasions.",

The crust was thin with a nice crisp, yet at the same time still had some chewiness resulting in a perfect combination. We also got a FULL basket of fried dill pickle chips which were perfectly prepared and addictingly delicious!  The atmosphere here is welcoming, and we chose to sit inside but next to the opened garage door. We then noticed the heat lamps in the ceiling over the outdoor seating, which will be nice when we go again and want to sit outside without being uncomfortably cold while we eat.

Bonus: the couple who own and work the place are genuinely nice and interesting people. We were treated as honored guests and my huge service dog and my equally huge service dog in training were welcomed. The only reason I left off one star on atmosphere was because the neighborhood is a little bit shabby, but there appears to be a movement to revitalize it. I was not the least concerned to be there.

The prices of the food were very expensive, you would think they would have money to get better cups. I found a bug in my food and that wasn't very appetizing anymore, although It did taste good until I found the bug. I picked it out and set it aside, I have a photo showing the bug. I got disgusted so I didn't really eat much afterwards. Took a long time to get my check and then we paid in cash, and it took about 5 minutes to get my change. A little upsetting I'll be honest...\nWaiter checked on us a good amount of times so service was decent. I never told them about the bug to not make a fuss. The chili sauce that was on the tables had the texture of old sauce on top, therefore my family scooped the sauce from the bottom. We ordered 3 bowls of Pho, and got 2 plates of bean sprouts, which, for my family was more than enough but wouldn't it make sense to give 3 plates for 3 bowls...\nthere was music in the background and the place is pretty quiet.\nI would go again and recommend the place, its not too dirty but just because of the bug I have decided to never come here again.",

This particular dining establishment offers a diverse array of dishes featuring flavorful meat broths and unique add-on options that I had not encountered elsewhere. The portions and accompaniments on our plates were more than satisfactory, and the prices were quite reasonable. We decided to savor their vegetable summer rolls and tofu pho accompanied by extra eggs in meat broth on the side which made pho taste more creamy. Additionally, the presentation included a delectable spicy chili paste, perfectly balanced in its spiciness and heat level. I must also mention the delightful peanut sauce that accompanied the summer rolls. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting. If you appreciate Vietnamese cuisine and beverages, this spot is an excellent choice for a leisurely brunch. While we didn't sample any cocktails from their impressive bar, the freshly prepared food was truly delightful, serving generous portions. I thoroughly enjoyed the excellent service, decent fare, and, notably, the exceptional chili paste at this establishment.",

            "Wonderful service the food was delicious only the sweet and sour chicken could've been better was kinda soggy but everything else I got was great",
            "I first started going to this restaurant years ago during college. I have since come here every time I am back in the Troy area. I. love the general tso's tofu as well as the various braised rice dishes. The bubble tea is also very good, although the 'bubbles' can sometimes be inconsistent textures. The guy that works there is very nice and it's lovely to see him every time we go. There used to be dine-in seating but that has been removed since Covid.",
            "Delicious taiwanese food at good prices.  Highly recommend mince pork over rice.  This is a take out place so the atmosphere isnt super nice, its perfect to order ahead, grab your food and go\n\nThe guy working here is always nice, though sometimes is very busy.  The drinks here are good too- they have an ample variety of teas.",
            "Orange chicken is so delicious! Love the broccoli as well! Ive been twice now and quality is consistent! I would definitely recommend!",
            "Great Taiwanese food and very reasonable prices. I would suggest calling ahead because they're a small mom and pop shop and get backed up when it's busy."

            "I appreciate having some type of Chinese food that\u2019s similar to home.\n\nSo far it\u2019s the closest thing to the food in NYC. So I\u2019ll drive and grab my food from here.\n\nI usually order my food beforehand and it\u2019s available when I arrive. I pay in cash because I\u2019ve read the reviews of issues with card payments (haven\u2019t had any dilemmas).\n\nThe food is hot when I get it. I check my order and things are usually there.\n\nIt just threw me off that I had to stand outside to grab my food the first time I went to pickup my foot. It  reminded me of the 24 hour bodega with the spin around windows in the city.\n\nI recommend eating here. Just pay in cash and check your order. They\u2019re busy\u2026 and human. Expect a mistake to occur occasionally. So always check your order when you\u2019re getting take out.",

            "A lot of the negative reviews here suggest that people misunderstand efficiency for rudeness. Yes, the employees are blunt and quick, but that's to be expected when the shop is non-stop. I stood at the counter for about ten minutes and the phone never stopped ringing, so if the complainers take their business to where they'll be sufficiently coddled, this place won't suffer.\n\nThat said, I got take-out from here tonight. The service was efficient, the food was good and the prices were fair. That's all I wanted and that's exactly what I got."

If you\u2019re looking for Chinese food in Brunswick (and it\u2019s not easy to find!), this place delivers. I had the general tso chicken - delicious. And the shumai was wonderful!

In fact, there's no picture of my order since it arrived so fast and hot and smelled excellent I simply forgot to take one. The General Tso's chicken with white rice was spectacular.

It was my first time there.\nThe service was quick, the young man who took my order was pleasant, the menu had what I wanted and the lunch specials were priced well. Unfortunately I ordered chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce and when I got it home discovered that there was no eggplant in my dish. It was good, as was the spring rolls and sesame chicken dinner, but it was a disappointment for me not to get what I wanted. I will probably go back and try again at some point since the food was tasty.",

            "I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Kebab Zone, and it was an absolutely delightful experience! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a cozy atmosphere that made me feel right at home.\n\nThe menu is packed with a fantastic variety of dishes, but the kebabs are truly the star of the show. I tried the mixed grill platter, and every bite was bursting with flavor. The meats were perfectly seasoned and cooked to juicy perfection. The accompanying sides, from the fresh salad to the aromatic rice, were the perfect complement to the kebabs.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the attention to detail\u2014the presentation of the food was top-notch, and you could tell that a lot of care went into every dish. The portion sizes were generous, and the prices were very reasonable, especially considering the high quality of the food.\n\nThe service was also excellent\u2014friendly, attentive, and quick without feeling rushed. It\u2019s clear that The Kebab Zone takes great pride in both their food and their customer service.\n\nOverall, The Kebab Zone is a must-visit for anyone who loves authentic, delicious kebabs and a welcoming dining experience. I can\u2019t wait to go back and try more from their menu! Highly recommended! \ud83e\udd59\ud83d\udd25"

Fast forwarding to the food, AMAZING! It still showed up hot. The chicken was great! Crispy and the sauce was awesome! Crab Rangoon seemed homemade to me. The egg rolls were hot and crispy with huge pieces of shrimp and chicken, and that homemade duck sauce was fire!!!\n\nI could go into detail but whatever.

            "I recently had the opportunity to dine at Brown's Brewing in Troy, and I must say, the location is absolutely stunning. Overlooking the beautiful Hudson River, the restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating, making it a perfect spot for enjoying a meal with family and friends. The ambiance is inviting, and the seating arrangements are well thought out, providing a comfortable experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food and beer \u2013 both were exceptional! The menu features a variety of delicious options that cater to different tastes, and the craft beers are some of the best I've had. It's clear that the kitchen and brewing team take pride in their offerings, and it truly enhances the dining experience.\n\nHowever, I did encounter some issues with the service that I feel compelled to mention. There seemed to be a lack of coordination between the reservation desk and the seating arrangements. Despite seeing several empty tables that were not reserved, we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. This was frustrating, especially since it appeared that other guests who arrived after us were served much more quickly.\n\nWhile I want to emphasize that my experience may not reflect the restaurant as a whole, I did feel that the service was somewhat biased. Again, I want to clarify that I am not suggesting any intentional discrimination, but it was disheartening to witness a disparity in service. Regardless, I chose to leave a 20% tip because I wanted to focus on the positive aspects of the meal and leave with good memories.\n\nOverall, while the food and atmosphere at Brown's Brewing are fantastic, the service left something to be desired. Unfortunately, this experience has led me to decide that it will be my last visit. I hope they can address these issues in the future, as the potential for a great dining experience is certainly there.",
            "I have been here at least 10 times over the past 10 years and it\u2019s always solid. I seek out their cherry raz beer which is outstanding! The ambiance is great too. Indoors, they have a bar and dining area downstairs and more dining upstairs.  I had my engagement dinner and graduation dinner upstairs over in the past and it was great!\n\nLove their outdoor patio area as well. My husband and I came on a Friday evening but still got seated right away outside. We shared the artichoke dip, I had the Moroccan tuna and my hubby had the short rib tacos. 1 star was lost because surprisingly the Moroccan tuna was very bland. It was encrusted in sesame seeds and tasted like\u2026. Nothing. I will admit I don\u2019t know what Moroccan food is \u201cfamous\u201d for or what to expect but I just imagined in my head something exotic, maybe a little spicy or something and I didn\u2019t get that.\n\nWe\u2019ll definitely be back, I\u2019ll just skip the tuna next time.",

            "Lovely evening event in the Hudson room upstairs. We were able to decorate in a simple, elegant fall theme. Staff was attentive, responsive and pleasant, food was excellent - guests were surprised it was more than basic bar food. We had a buffet and a 2 hour bar tab, worked very well to enable lots of mingling, but with seating for everyone, too. The atmosphere was just right, a combination of the social quality of a bar but still a private space. Highly recommend for events. Many thanks to Nicki for managing the event and to Jeff for attending to all of us."

The lunch menu isn't large, and we wanted something different, so we ordered the chick pea salad and industrial eggplant sandwiches. The chick pea salad was surprisingly  delicious, and my eggplant was also impressively tasty. And then I realized our meals were vegan as well (we are not vegetarians). I cut the eggplant sandwich in half (which squished it a little) and took a picture so you can see the layers of flavor.\nThe fries were also very good. Very simple, like the frenchfries we would get decades ago. No coating. No processing, just fries good well.\nWe want to try their breakfast next time!\nAtmosphere was old fashioned and simple, but fun. Like a luncheonette from the 60's. Great music.",
            "I\u2019ve been to Naughters twice, and honestly, I\u2019m a little surprised by its high rating.\n\nIt\u2019s an adorable diner with charming interiors that have a vintage vibe. When you enter, you\u2019ll find a few tables and some bar seats. Due to the limited seating, depending on the day and time, you might encounter a wait.\n\nThe menu at Naughters is small. I\u2019ve tried their vegetable hash and the eggplant sandwich. The food was just okay, but it was nice to see the chefs cooking right in front of you in the open kitchen. The staff were quick, patient, and attentive. The coffee was also just okay.\n\nOne advantage this spot has is that it\u2019s open till 2:30 AM on Fridays and Saturdays, making it a potential go-to for a late-night bite after drinks.\n\nI felt like my experience was pretty average, and I probably wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to visit again.",

Super cool vibes and great staff, the food is simple.  Sometimes have to wait a bit as its very small inside but usually things move fairly quickly.  Love the coffee refills too.  Homefries, egg, toast, bacon egg and cheese are all good\n\nCant wait to try the chopped cheese",

We missed it the first time because we didn\u2019t see a sign.\nWe will definitely be back to try their lunch and dinner menus.",
            "Went out for a bite to eat in downtown Troy, one of the only place we found serving food late at night. We ordered eggs and home fries others at the bar had the chopped cheese sandwich and the fresh toast sticks were HUGE ended up sharing with 3 friends. Fair prices and good food. I liked the old school bar stools and the staff were friendly and accommodating. Check them out for a bite to eat early or late!"

Nowadays, five is my limit. I always grab five extra \"for later\" since five just isn't enough. One other strong point that keeps me coming back is that they serve RC cola and 7 up - two of my favorite soft drinks. Thanks again, Scott !"

We took a group of over 30 and yet the staff kept up with no issues. A whole bunch of items on the menu that sounded great, the wings were fantastic.  Additionally \"to go cups\" are available if you want to take an adult beverage to the rink. This definitely needs to be on your to do list if you're in the area"

            "This was my third outing here and it's always a huge hit with the food. Even more so when you have awesome waiters like Javier that encourage you to dance after everyone's gone and you close down the restaurant with a private dance party. Thank you for that marvelous experience. We love coming here. Here's a picture of my delicious Wagyu Strip Steak:",
            "I had an amazing meal at the Roosevelt Room this past weekend. The spread was amazing and I was very impressed with the attention to detail that went in to every dish that graced our table.\n\nThe Filet of Atlantic Halibut was exquisite and the calamari was delicious. Our service was terrific and everything came out spot on. I would highly recommend the Roosevelt Room for anyone interested in finer dining options in the area. You will not be disappointed!",
            "We were impressed with such a fine dining experience. There were 4 of us in our party and each of our meals were delicious. The cowboy steak and filet mignon were cooked perfectly. The rack of lamb was outstanding! If you are looking for a culinary delight with exceptional service, look no further \ud83d\ude0a",
            "My husband and I ate at the Roosevelt Room last week and I haven\u2019t stopped raving about it since! First off - the atmosphere is classy and relaxed. The unique design & decor are unlike any other restaurant in the capital district; warm, inviting with hints of Italy. The staff was superb from the host to the servers, the bar staff, the chefs and the owner. They were attentive and knowledgeable of the food giving great recommendations. Watching the chefs work in the kitchen was like watching a fine tuned orchestra. Truly a pleasure to watch them in their craft. We are big \u201cfoodie\u201d people and came with high expectations after reviewing the menu online. I can genuinely say they blew us away! You will not find a menu like this ANYWHERE else I promise. They use fresh high quality products and cook it to perfection. We couldn\u2019t find a single thing that could be improved upon. Each table gets a fresh loaf of bread which in itself was delicious but I held back after 1 piece to save room. For appetizers we ordered the Red & Gold beet salad and the Spanish octopus. The owner was kind enough to send us the steak (filet mignon) tartar as well as cucumber carpaccio. The salad has a delicious dressing and the perfect mix to balance out the flavors, the octopus was tender and packed with flavor, the tartar was so chewy and delicious with the perfect sauces to compliment the flavors and the cucumber carpaccio has such a unique taste I couldn\u2019t stop going back for another taste. For our meals we both ordered the filet dinner - mine medium well, his medium. The cook was spot on for each, the potato fondant paired perfectly with the pearl onions but the sauce\u2026 the sauce had magic! I used what was left of our bread to soak it all up! The dessert menu had delicious options but unfortunately we were too full. Overall the Roosevelt Room is hands down the best place to eat in the capital district right now. We are hooked and will now be regulars. You have to try it!",
            "Enjoyed a fantastic experience, drinks and wine list reasonably priced for the selection and creativity of the drinks.  Started with the short rib dumplings, rich and bold flavor that also went  well with the brightness of the second selection of the carpaccio with foie gras mousse, both fantastic.  Their bread is warm, crusty and served with a homemade butter\u2026delicious!  We were offered an amuse bouche deviled egg topped with caviar\u2026lovely treat.\n\nDinner selections we chose were the seabass with a butternut pur\u00e9e and roasted beets and the halibut, both fish choices were cooked to perfection and the ingredients flavor showed through in every perfect bite.  You can order sides but we were so satisfied with the choices as they were and the portions were excellent, did not want to get too full.\n\nService was top notch, it\u2019s refreshing to see the owner and the chef so involved and making their rounds to see each table and ask how everything is.  Michael was kind and generous as was his talented chef.  Excellent experience and excellent menu.  I HIGHLY recommend a visit to the Roosevelt room."

We ordered a few drinks at the bar they were delicious, would love to go back another time and try out the food as well",
            "I celebrated my 25th birthday here with my twin sister and group of about 10 friends and we had a blast! I had never been before but loved the atmosphere and rustic decor. It was hard to decide what drink to order because all the speciality cocktails looked good but I went with a blood orange margarita and enjoyed it very much. The drinks were a little on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for. The service was amazing and they gave me and my sister complimentary birthday shots which was very nice of them. We ordered some appetizers, including the pretzel bites and fries and they were very tasty and shareable portions. It is also in a very central location in Troy, so a perfect place to start off the night before hitting up other bars. I will definitely be back!",
            "Had an absolutely wonderful evening out. A bit louder than I expected (in my mind, it was low-key and intimate), but nonetheless we had a great time. The pizza was delishly fresh with a nice crisp on the crust, yet soft, and the wings were quite good (not the best I've had). Drinks were stiff, and their local crafts brews were plentiful (the cider donut one was A++). Will return!",

Our waitress was wonderful, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu and pairing recommendations. Every time she came by our table we ended up chatting for several minutes. The food was delicious and affordable compared to other restaurants in the area. The drink menu included fun, seasonal selections with fresh ingredients. I ended up going to EMBY\u2019S Garden later  that week with some friends."

It got here within an hour, food is solid, cooked perfectly, huge portions, they even threw in a free 2 liter. General Tso (Dragon and Phoenix) especially, among the best I've had. Sweet with just a hint of spice. I dislike that they make you sign the receipt even when paying online (are they disinfecting the pen regularly?), but that is my only complaint. Hope to visit the restaurant someday. It's a gem hidden in plain sight, try it out next time you get a craving.",

My husband and I shared a platter for 2  (we requested a half meat and half vegetarian option, which they were happy to accommodate). It was a really impressive array of foods and a very generous portion. Everything was really fresh and delicious. Their housemade lavash bread was incredible, very soft with a crispy exterior. The best I've ever had. The meats all had a beautiful char and were moist and tasty. All of the vegetables were fresh and well seasoned as well.  I live nearby and will definitely be coming back to try other menu items as often as possible. Thanks so much for the delicious meal!\nThe atmosphere is simple with a family oriented feeling.

Used to be called I Love NY Pizza but Troy is more appropriate :) Always has lots of choices for walk in counter pick up, and my favorite is their broccoli. I've tried many slices and never a bad bite. They heat it back up and Im outta there in ten minutes total. I've stayed to eat at their tables a few times but I can't give it a 5 for atmosphere. The only atmosphere it has is \"hot delicious quick pizza\" not murals on the wall or fancy lights. If atmosphere is what you want go somewhere else, but you will be missing out on the yummy pizza!! It is a high traffic area so you are in and out. Yes it is clean and the staff are nice. Decently priced, grab a slice!",
            "Forget fancy toppings and gourmet ingredients, at I Love New York Pizza in Troy, you'll find something truly special: authentic pizza done right with flavor at a price thats affordable. And let me tell you, their chicken marsala pizza is a revelation!\n\nThis isn't your average pizza with a few measly chicken chunks and a drizzle of sauce. Juicy, tender chicken bathes in a rich, mushroom-infused marsala sauce that perfectly complements the tangy tomato base. Every bite is an explosion of flavor, perfectly balanced and oh-so-satisfying. I honestly believe it might be one of the best chicken marsala pizza I've ever had in the capital region.\n\nThe crust is not too thick, not too thin, with a perfect amount of chew. It's the kind of crust that holds its own without overpowering the toppings, creating the ideal foundation for flavortown. Every slice is a masterpiece, and at their prices, you won't feel guilty ordering another (or two).\n\nSpeaking of prices, let's just say I Love New York Pizza lives up to its name in more ways than one. You won't find a better deal for such high-quality pizza in the entire Capital District. This is probably one of the last bastions of true, classic pizza places left, where they focus on quality ingredients and delicious simplicity, not trendy gimmicks.\n\nAnd the service? Fast, friendly, and exactly what you expect from a classic pizza joint. No fuss, no muss, just good vibes and good eats.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an excellent pizza experience that won't break the bank, stop searching and head straight to I Love New York Pizza in Troy. You won't regret it! Just be sure to try the chicken marsala pizza \u2013 it's a game-changer!",

I can\u2019t sell that.\u201d I apologized and they just hung up. Whoever was on the phone was rude, and needs some classes in customer service.",

            "In town on business and did some Yelping to see what was good in the area. I checked out this place and their menu then made the decision. Here's how it went...\n\nAtmosphere/Appearance: Right off of a city street is this gem. It's got a good mixture of a dive bar and a decent pub. They were in the middle or doing some renovations so I'm excited to see what the new interior looks like when they're all done! For now there's lots of darker woods all over along with a decent bar rail right near the front entrance. Along the back wall is a very long bench seat paired with tables that you can push together to form one long one. It's a college town so it was a bit loud inside, but you kind-of expect that from these types of bars.\n\nService: Katie took great care of us. She was so friendly, charismatic, funny and just overall brought an extra level of joy to our dining experience.\n\nFood: I saw wings on the menu so l went for it. They had a list of flavors with some interesting names. I went with the \"Brother Rob Hot\" which is supposed to be some super hot sauce, but it wasn't. It had a good amount of eat and great flavor, but it's nothing to be afraid of. Another flavor I got was the Buffalo Garlic Parmesan. It was delicious and my preferred sauce over the others. Next up was Medium. Medium was medium. I also got the chance to try their Honey BBQ which was a great deep, tangy flavor with natural-tasting sweetness. Last, but not least was the \"Sauce of the Day\" a sweet, tangy, honey-based selection. It was okay, but quite different. The wings were also big, juicy and not fried so much to where they were burnt. Their house-made bleu cheese was fantastic and went perfectly with the spiciness of the wings.\n\nValue: 20 big juicy wings with bleu cheese, celery and carrots will run you $28.00. Given the size of them and that I can get more than 1 FULL MEAL out of them makes them worth it for sure.\n\nI'd totally come back here specifically for the wings. It's a nice chill place to hang out with your friends or coworkers to get a beer, some food and take a load off for the day.",

Come here and get treated well. 30+ beers on tap. Awesome time. Would definitely come back.",
            "This was my first visit.  Loved it!  After business hours you can park in the lot across the street.  Very convenient.  Not really a dive or ruin pub, but really good local pub.",
            "This place has been a solid place to enjoy beers in Troy for well over a decade of me knowing about it. The prices have climbed with the economy so your Wing Burger is a bit more but the food is good and still competitive with the locals.\n\nThey have a cute outdoor patio, fun keg urinals, and shuffle board to play in the back. Plenty of space to enjoy an after work happy hour and I even saw some decent NA brews for anyone needing to DD.\n\nThe decor keeps to the Ruck standards and the staff are still welcoming and friendly. Comfortable to enjoy if you are a regular or if you drop in from time to time.\n\nOn a bigger plus they allow your pups to join you which makes another pup friendly destination in Troy NY.\n\nThank you\ud83d\ude01"

            "Admittedly, I did not eat, but the person I was with did and his food did look good.  The deviled eggs looked amazing.  Good bar selection of liquors and beer.  Very nice bartenders..1 in particular who has been with them for about 13 years..\nPlace was crowded and there was a wait.  I went for bar seating so no wait for a table.  They do have outdoor seating so evenings would be nice outside by the river.",

Crispy outside, melted cheese inside, and delicious sauce for dipping.",

Mind you it also took an hour and a half to be delivered. When I called to complain and ask for some sort of compensation they refused a partial refund and only offered 10% off my next order which really doesn\u2019t seem fair. Definitely will not be ordering from here again.",

            "We order a pizza or two from Giuseppe's Pizzeria and Deli almost every Friday. We have them deliver our order so we can't rate the atmosphere.\n\nOur old pizza place changed the menu,  ingredients, and location. We ordered from them 2 or 3 more times and didn't like the the way the food tasted  anymore. We started trying every pizzeria we had been mailed a menu or post card from.\n\nFinally, we tried Giuseppe's. They are a keeper! Their pizza is consistently delicious! We just tried a 2 cheese calzone and that was delicious too!\n\nWe have been ordering from Giuseppe's exclusively for 3 - 4 months now. We've been happy and satisfied with every order. We really like the pizza with meatballs.\n\nWe don't rate many restaurants 5 stars. Our experience has been when we've been ordering from a place once a week for 3 or 4 weeks the service and quality goes down. It's like they seem to take our loyalty for granted.\n\nNot Giuseppe's, the food and service is constantly top notch, we highly recommend them!!!",
            "So I decided not to make pizza tonight like we normally do on Friday nights. We are a bit of pizza snobs. My husband ordered from the pizzeria and the pizza was a hit in this house. The crust was cooked perfectly and has wonderful crunch while still being light and soft with just enough chew. What was even better than the crust was the antipasto that we ordered. No slimy lettuce and cheap cold cuts here! All the veggies were fresh and they use quality Italian cold cuts. We cannot wait to order again! Thanks for making dinner for us tonight."

My Dad and I both got the chicken jerk. It was a little spicy for my taste, but I can appreciate good cooking regardless. My Dad loved it. I'd go back. I most likely WILL return at some point.

No seasoning on the chicken and the cabbage was plain. The rice was okay but drowned by curry heat.  It was spicy but unflavorful overall. Didn't finish it. There are other places that deliver spice with great seasoning."

            "The Daisy is a cute chic taco and margarita place. The tacos are fusion, they have a bulgogi one with kimchi and a fried chicken and a coconut shrimp one plus others. Not authentic Mexican tacos but stills delicious. Classy place.\n\nThe margaritas are strong! I saw a sign for buy one get one margaritas on Wednesdays. They have a decent amount of tables even though it\u2019s a small place, there is a back room with more tables.\n\nThe servers were attentive and friendly.\n\nThe coconut margarita was creamy and I liked the coconut shreds on the rim. Margaritas and tacos are all around $13. Tacos come with 2. Bill can definitely add up but it\u2019s worth it. Great environment to catch up with friends.\n\nThe chip appetizer with pico de gallo was delicious. The chips had a great crisp, they tasted deep fried. Perfectly salted. I liked my coconut shrimp tacos the best. 2 big meaty shrimp in each taco, crunchy and cooked well and the pineapple in it gave it a nice sweetness. The fried chicken tacos were a mix of dark and light meat chunks, which were very tender and soft. Though a bit too soft for my likening of chicken texture. And the sauce has a very strong cilantro flavor.\n\nIf I\u2019m in the area again I would love to come back and try other tacos and margarita flavors!",
            "The place is very cute and cozy. My friend and I went there last month and I had the bulgogi tacos without the shell and a classic margarita. We really liked the ambiance, service, and the reasonable prices so we came back the second time last week! This time we had Coconut Shrimp and Beef Bulgogi with the shell  now!\n\nI love the fusion of two cultures here. highly recommended!",
            "Went for tacos and margaritas on a Wednesday night. The tacos and margaritas were all good; the flavors were great. I think I loved the fried chicken taco the best. Any one with the aji verde sauce is a winner! The only problem with the tacos were that they were really small; like 2 bites each. I could eat the nachos all day, they were soo good. The margaritas were buy one get one free and were good. Service left a little to be desired. They would ask if we needed anything quickly and walk away before everyone responded. They were hard to catch when we did need something. When it came to the bill we were told we had to ask for separate checks at the beginning but they never told us that at the beginning. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f still had a great time but compared to similar places, it was just ok.",

The Korean beef spicy but yummy melted in your mouth.  I am not a big fan of pork but I would get that again.\n\nBoth items 5 stars.\n\nWe did the eats in the streets. Great time and friendly people.\n\nWill definitely be back.",

The historic 1910 building has an old timey feeling juxtaposed against the industrial decor.  The menu is small, but well thought out.   There are creative cocktails and a few wine choices.   The tater tots are a must try.  Delightful little gluten bombs that melt in your mouth.  The fish sandwich, and fish and chips are spot on.  The breading is panko and keeps everything light and crunchy.  The burger was excellent and cooked to perfection.  The desserts were interesting, but not showstoppers. Just like the sister restaurants, this one is in the winner's circle."

He says we are closed,  call back tomorrow.\nI am pissed to say the least.",

I'm glad there's a burger on the menu because it was the only thing he was interested in, so that's something to keep in mind if you have younger kids or picky eaters. The pickles on our burgers were the best part, as they were amazing. They said they had to seat us at the bar because we didn't have a reservation, which was kinda weird because the place was mostly empty the whole time we were there, but the bartender was incredibly sweet. I will say that it is very expensive. I got one mixed drink, my son had a root beer, and our two burgers and fries was $75 including the tip.",

From the fried calamari and wonderful oil with basil, garlic, herb and Parmesan cheese for dipping bread started the evening perfectly paired with  Pinot noir wine.

Also had the peperoni bread with marinara which was 5 stars!\nGreat staff and service, plenty of parking. They have an extensive variety on the menu which never disappoints. Treat yourself!",
            "Despite the heavy Northern West coast style rain that plagued our region last night, we had delicious dinner out with friends, which delighted us. Amongst what we enjoyed were a an appetizer of Portobello mushrooms and roasted peppers. These were delicious! The soup du jour was large bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder, cooked to perfection.\n\nThe main Main meals consisted of a \u201cSteak Michael,\u201d which was saut\u00e9ed in a natural beef sauce with mushrooms, asparagus, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and yellow peppers. A Lobster Imperial: 2 four-ounce lobster tails and crab meat, saut\u00e9ed in a white cream sauce, which was delicious with generous proportions.\nAnd finally, a dish of Fried Sausage and Peppers, saut\u00e9ed in a meat sauce with spaghetti, also in a meat sauce.\ufffc\n\nThat, along with a nice bottle of Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo wine, and two bowls of steamed clams, which were only $5.00 a dozen on special, made for a delicious evening, along with a lively conversation peppered throughout.\n\nDespite being extremely busy, even for a 6 o\u2019clock reservation on a Wednesday night, the service, largely performed by a coterie of young women who were very professional and quick, came quite rapidly and efficiently. Everyone was friendly, cordial and professional. I wondered why so many people were there mid week. The reason was that they have a periodic special on Wednesdays with steamed clams, which again were a bargain at only five dollars a dozen. Highly recommended. Buon appetito!",

            "We stopped by at the end of the day on a Friday.  First, the atmosphere inside was cheery and welcoming. It reminded me of a bar like the old series \u201cCheers\u201d or the Ben Affleck movie \u201cThe Tender Bar\u201d - people were gathered like old friends at the end of a long work week. Katy was the bartender and server - very welcoming, upbeat- we can\u2019t say enough about the great service we got.  Now the food - we had read great reviews from Facebook and finally had a chance to try it out. We were not disappointed! This is pub food better than best - it\u2019s the real deal. First we started with an order of honey BBQ bone in wings (they have many sauce flavor options)- best we\u2019ve had in the capital region - hot, crispy, large sized and absolutely delicious. Next we tried the plain Mac and cheese and it, too, was delicious- lovely melted cheese on top of cavatappi pasta with a lovely blend of creamy cheeses underneath. We didn\u2019t need to add any salt because the flavors were perfectly delicious already. Next we had the pulled pork sandwich that came with Cole slaw and their homemade, hand cut fries. I opted for onion rings. Can\u2019t even begin to describe how delicious everything was - the pulled pork had excellent smoky tenderness, the Cole slaw was delicious \u2014 (too many places just can\u2019t make a good Cole slaw but this place has it down !)\nAnd then there are the fries and onion rings - wow - both were excellent! Super flavor and perfect light crispy texture- haven\u2019t had good fries/onion rings like this in years! The menu had many other pub fare options from chicken to salads and burgers. It\u2019s a small cozy place inside, people are very friendly. Highly recommend this place. Katy was great and she makes a top notch White Russian. Our hats go off to the chefs/cooks for the extra mile on serving amazing pub food that sets this place apart from so many other places in the Capital Region"

            "A few nights ago, I ordered a medium cheese pizza.\n\nIt took over an hour for the pizza to arrive, and I only live a few blocks up the road. My pizza only showed up after I called to check on its status and they told me the driver was on his way. When it got here five minutes later, it was merely warm, which tells me it had been sitting and might possibly have been forgotten.\n\nNormally, I give restaurants the benefit of the doubt, but this time, I didn't feel the wait time justified the tip. It's important to note I am fully plastic and do not carry cash, so I tip via a percentage option in the charge card app the drivers use on their phones. So, as soon as the option came up, I pressed \"No Tip,\" and what happened next is the reason for my review.\n\nWhen you pay with a debit card, the charge card app has a final signature screen. Every regular Amante driver that has ever delivered to me in the past has held their phone out for me to digitally sign. This driver was not familiar to me and as soon as I clicked \"no tip,\" he yanked his phone away and began to walk off.\n\nWhen I told him I still needed to sign for it, he scribbled on the line himself and then held it out for me to see. In the moment, I let it go because I wanted to eat my pizza confrontation-free, but on principle, I need to make the business aware of the fact.

            "A great Italian restaurant that has been around for over 60 years. I had two thick pork chops that were excellent. It came with a soup or salad plus two more sides plus bread was put on the table. HUGE portions reasonably priced. I highly recommend. Heather our waitress was very busy, but did a fine job. 6-13-24 This is my go to restaurant  for the largest, most tender, tasty pork chops in the land. I counted 5 sides. Apple sauce, bread, salad, french fries, broccoli. Still the same huge portions. Very reasonably priced. I highly recommend",

No greeting, no personality from any of the wait staff and no commutation skills at all.  My days of eating there are over."

Restrooms were super spacious, private, and clean. Lights slightly dimmed but not too much. Our waitress was sweet and attentive without being over bearing. She had great knowledge of the menu and answered all our questions. The truffle potato appetizer was amazing! We both ordered the prime filet steak and it was cooked perfectly and had a great sauce. Lots of wine to choose from. Our table was in the middle but we could still see the kitchen and the cooks. This restaurant made our night out a special time! Would definitely come back here again!",

We sat at the chefs table and we enjoyed watching everyone hard at work in the kitchen while we enjoyed our dinner. I can\u2019t wait to experience the dessert room and have events in \u201cThe Gallery\u201d. The food was top notch. Our ribeye/ filet was cooked perfectly and the sides complimented them beautifully. I wish I had words to explain how delicious and beautiful the dessert was, but there isn\u2019t. It\u2019s easily in my top 5 favorite desserts I\u2019ve ever had in my lifetime. It was an experience in itself.\n\nScarlet Knife is an experience and I cannot wait to come back!",

I love that the menu add wine pairings for food items, which is really fun to try.\nAppetizers: cheese board and oysters\nDinner: French onion short rib and grilled ribeye\n\nWe didn't check out the dessert room, but certainly had some dessert. The pistachio creme brulee and raspberry rose sorbet were a deliciously unique pairing.\n\nAt the end of our meal, we were approached by both the manager and chef (separately) about our experience which was really nice.\n\nWe will definitely come back!",

            "Sat in the De Fazio garden this afternoon and enjoyed a chicken and herb salad and a cheese pizza.\n\nThe outdoor space is quaint with an herb garden in the rear.  When we walked in, there was a wonderful aroma. I don't know what it was, but it smelled delicious.\n\nA young lady greeted us and walked us to the garden area.  The service was excellent.\n\nThis place has been in S. Troy for a long time, and you can tell they have an uncompromising quality.\n\nFirst they brought some garlic bread. My guess is that they use an infused olive oil.  The garlic and herb flavor on this bread is delectable.\n\nThe pizza came out first. What stood out for me are the ingredients.  The cheese is high quality, not greasy and flavorful.  Their pizza sauce is fresh, mild and delicious.  It has a very slight  sweetness, with fresh herbs.  It is not spicy. Perfect for a bold red wine.\n\nThe salad is fresh and has roasted red pepper, a medium provolone (a little sharp), cherry tomatoes, leafy greens, black olive and red onions. The chicken was slightly over-cooked, but seasoned nicely.  I'd definitely get it again.\n\nI decided to get the hangover cake to go.  This cake is so good.  I think it made its way into my top 5 cakes.  You must try it.\n\nOverall a great experience.",
            "Food is excellent- pizza- ravioli - hangover cake but to dine here is rough. Saw a few luxury brand cars pull up, start to park, then just drive away. The exterior used to define the epicenter of Little Italy. Dining is outside and down an alley to a backyard area with metal furniture and a mostly failed attempt at garden, al fresco ambience. Still, the server was pleasant but dine-in is not this place's jam tough big potential. Food is excellent and worth it. Check in at pizza spot not the store or alley to be seated.",
            "Everyone kept telling me to try DeFazio's Pizzeria because my boys are pizza monsters, and we haven't had our socks knocked off yet since moving to the area. I didn't have any prior knowledge of the place, and we just walked in, not knowing it was completely booked up with reservations. They were still incredibly kind, and made my kids a pizza anyway for us to take home. It only took about 15 mins, and the guy up front was nice enough to even bring it out to our car. We all agreed (even the 6 year old with the bougie palate) that it was the best pizza we have had so far in the capital district. I highly recommend!\n\nWe also grabbed some cookies, and they were also immediately devoured."

            "Normally I can deal with a mistake or two.  But, I went to pick up my order and was given a completely wrong order.  Original order was for two double cheeseburgers, both with bacon, and a large fry. When I got home and opened the bag, both burgers were extemely skimpy single cheeseburgers, no bacon to be found anywhere, and if the fry was really a large, that is completely laughable.  My order seemed to be one of the only ones at the time, I was the only order sitting behind the register and there was no one at the restaurant. I could see if it was busy and orders were flying out the door a mistake could perhaps be made.  This was not the case.  Extremely disappointed for two burgers and fries that came to a $40 total. Also, mealeo platform provided no help and told me to reach out directly to the business. Bad all around, do not recommend at all.\n\nEDIT: Mealeo refunded my full purchase after opening a dispute via Paypal.  very nice gesture",

Now that is some REAL service right there. Who does that today? There is always a feeling of having to rush through a meal, so thank you for not making us feel rushed -- even though we didn't stick around too long afterwards.\n\nI met Jared today as well, stand-up guy, gave me a handshake and all. I told him I would be back, and I will be coming back!\n\nPictures are of Baja Tacos, and the Bacon Blue -- I'm fat and I already started digging into that. I had that with the onion rings and homemade blue cheese .. sheesh it was delicious. Also, get the Calamari (extra crispy). UPDATE: pictures are of the Reuben (yeah I took a bite), fish and chips, and Kickin Chicken sandwich all \ud83d\udd25\n\nDon't wait, don't hesitate just go there and you will enjoy it.\n\nI can't wait to go back honestly\n\nThank me later.\nVin Vin",

My expectations have been low for a long time as I've noticed it getting harder and harder to find NY style pizzas anywhere, including in NY itself.\n\nThe place is nice and clean with a few tables but I think it is more of a pick up kind of place.  The pizzas are all handmade and thin.  The staff was extremely friendly.  I could have been swindled however the staff was nice to let me know my order qualified for a promotion and I was able to get a discount.\n\nThe pizza itself was good.  Not great but well above average.  I could have done with a touch more cheese and more of the toppings but this is being extremely nitpicky.  Compared to the other pizza joints in the area, if you are looking for NY style, this is as close as you will get.  I would come back here again without hesitation."

Also ordered the chicken parm dinner. The pizza was very crispy and had lots of sauce on the top. The chicken parm portions was just right.

The rest of the food is good, nicely sized portion Italian dishes. Apps are typical fried food but Don\u2019t get the calamari LOL. The antipasto is great, exactly like a traditional Italian salad and it\u2019s huge layered with delicious flavor.

The food was exceptional\u2014we enjoyed seafood chowder special (the best we\u2019ve ever had), chili, salmon, and a club sandwich. The staff was incredibly friendly, and it was easy to get on and off State Highway 7, making it a perfect, convenient spot for travelers.",
            "Delicious food fast friendly staff. Amazing specials for dinner and dessert. I'm difficult to please with Chicken riggies being from the Utica area but was pleasantly surprised with the dinner special! If only it had cherry peppers not red bell. \ud83d\ude15 Peanut butter cup cheese cake for take home!!",
            "Had a quick dinner here 5/17/24 , Although the food was good \u2026the cocktail was better than the meal.( \ud83d\udc4f great Bartender!) Appetizers scored=50/50 Mozzarella sticks were perfect but boneless wings tasted like chicken meatballs and looked like them as well..(minced chicken \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f)  I ordered the Bacon Mushroom Burger \ud83c\udf54 medium well.. received it with NO Bacon and was well done, which was OK... My Dinner Partner ordered a Hot Sandwich ..chips loosely on the side of the sandwich would have been classier but it literally came with a small bag of Lays Chips.. That were OUTDATED by 5 months stamped best if used by 12/23!  The waitress was wonderful and the meal came rather quickly. Atmosphere was good yet, tables were too close\u2026 it was quite the maze to leave.. OVERALL \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
            "I had pizza. It was really good. Nothing spectacular but was tasty. My husband had the chicken Parm and it was outstanding too huge pieces of chicken, a mild marinara sauce and it comes with a side of spaghetti. It was really good.",
            "Moved back to my hometown and was so happy the Zotto\u2019s reopened a new place. The best pizza, and wings around. Brunswick needed this place!!! All the waitresses were amazing and welcoming too!!"

            "Extremely small portions when you order online compared to going in person. The tortillas are not handmade despite claiming to be a Mexican restaurant. Looks like they went to taco bell to get my food. I measured the amount of rice they gave me, 2 tablespoons, oof. The \"chili\" I ordered was also extremely watered down as well, almost not even worth putting in my food at that point.\n\nAlso, notice how every positive review is them eating in person... hmm...",

            "The restaurant is located within a strip shopping center near the Walmart, it was very pleasant, with plenty of outdoor seating.  it was a very friendly restaurant. The staff and their service was so quick we thought they had the wrong table when they brought out the food.\n\nEverything was cooked as we ordered it. there was plenty there and the prices were quite reasonable.\n\nBig heaping plate of nacho chips and salsa within seconds of sitting down and drinks came out just as fast.\n\nI would definitely go back again.",
            "Kids and family love this restaurant.\n\nThe food comes out super fast and it's always delicious.\n\nThe staff are very respectful and kind. They are so gentle with kids as well.\n\nNothing but good things to say about this establishment. Every time I go, I order something new. I haven't had a bad dish yet.",
            "I come here very often to the point where the waitress Maria sees me and my fiance and smiles and greets us. The waitstaff are super friendly and attentive. The lights are nice and dimmed, and the whole atmosphere is very warm and inviting. The food is absolutely wonderful and flavorful. I love everything I've tried here. Absolutely worth a try as their prices are more than reasonable."

Such great service, and the food presentation is art!\nAnd its not expensive! Very reasonable prices, especially considering how much food you get! I very highly recommend this place for everyone!",
            "Reviews look pretty good so I figured I would give it a shot. Everything that my expectations if you really enjoy Sushi you need to check this place out and is very clean and the food they prepare you as fresh made-to-order you can't judge a book by it's cover they crank out some good food out of that kitchen stop in and hang out for a few minutes or you can get it to go nice atmosphere and vibe"

            "Wow! Definitely my new go-to for \"Chinese takeout\" food was hot, fresh, and flavorful! The scallion pancakes were savory and crispy, braised pork ribs were super tender and the honeydew bubble tea was light and refreshing! Also I love that the combo came with hot and sour soup!!!  Everything was delicious!",
            "The pork was just like straight fat. I have never gotten pork fried rice like that. It didn't look like pork. Just like fat mush that was clear or white. It wasn't even pork color. I think green shell is better for the area serviced. This whole thing really grossed me out. I never post reviews but felt I had to mention this.",
            "If you are vegan or vegetarian, you need to try this place! I have been searching high and low for an Asian joint that actually cooks their tofu well. At most places, it\u2019s rubbery & slippery with some sauce splashed over it. Here, you can tell it\u2019s been pressed and/or baked \u2014 it has an incredibly firm texture and well-coated flavor (I got the sesame tofu). My non-vegetarian boyfriend also enjoyed his meal \u2014 he got a pork bun and General Tso\u2019s Chicken with fried rice. We were thoroughly impressed and will be returning. Don\u2019t let the unassuming exterior turn you away!",
            "Wow. First time ordering delivery from here and everything was so delicious! Our delivery came within 40 minutes. The ribs and udon were the best I ever had. The hot and sour soup tasted so fresh. Definitely will be ordering again.",
            "Couldn't take pictures ate my food before I could\nFood: I ordered a braised pork combo meal, chicken broccoli combo meal, and a small lo mein\ud83e\udd61. Combo meals come with white or fried rice and also a hot and sour soup\ud83c\udf72. I asked for no soup on one of the orders, and they instead gave me a egg roll\ud83d\ude0a\nBraised pork was soft and tender, the chicken broccoli was very flavorful, and the lo mein tasted like no other, very aromatic and umami. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the fact that the pork in the fried rice was not diced bits of red dyed \"pork' and actual soft pork. And the hot and sour soup had a coziness feel to it, I wanted more\ud83e\udd24\n\nSERVICE: We came in last minute hoping that they would accept our order and they did!!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4c They were very patient with us very enthusiastic aswell! As we were waiting for our food he handed a complimentary iced tea to test out and it was delicious \ud83d\ude0b will get one next time for sure!\n\nIn summary the food was DELICIOUS and I will be coming back again for more!! My only complaint is that I wished I could've had more of the soup\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83c\udf72"

            "My complaint here is not about the quality or taste of my meal. My complaint is with the BALT specifically. I can here with two other friends and their portion sizes were great and definitely worth the money. One friend got a burger with fries and 5 wings with a price of $20 personally I feel like that\u2019s a great price. By comparison I payed $14 and got a BLT with avocado  the problem is that the sandwich came with 3 pieces of bacon, two slices of lettuce, two slices of tomato, and one extremely disappointingly sized portion of avocado (as seen in the photo). I\u2019m disappointed in their judgment of the portions and felt like it should be known. But otherwise everything was nice and I\u2019ve come here before and would come here again.",
            "I did not even know this place was at this location.  Real happy with my 1st experience.  John was bartending and I found him to be knowledged, entertaining and super personable.  Food was OK...only got bar food.  Wings and Nachos.  We were happy with both.",

            "It's Juniors! This is one of the easiest places to meet up with coworkers after a long day at the office or just connecting with some friends for a quick drink and non-stop grill foods. The hosts are always super friendly, very accommodating, and they hustle to make sure everybody is tended to. They have outside dining as well, with a grill out back and patio chairs and tables up front. As busy as this place gets, it seems like there's always room for more people.  Everything on the menu is good to try and the prices are very reasonable. Given the location and great service, its no wonder this place is so popular."

            "Flew out to visit RPI when I was in high school over a decade ago. This place had the best pizza I'd ever had. Ended up going to a different college but always remembered the pizza here. Visited again recently. In a decade, tastes can change. Quality can change. I actually debated whether to go back, because I didn't want to ruin the good memory. Well I went back, and I'm glad I did. This is still the best pizza I've ever had!",

The crust has a taste similar to garlic bread which defines a big apple pizza. Give it a try!",

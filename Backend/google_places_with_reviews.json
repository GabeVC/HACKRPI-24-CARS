I do enjoy cooking around as I eat and there's plenty of little details around this place to enjoy while yo eat. I like to plants and the ceiling I noticed is made interesting to me. I like contrast to it, it's just unique and simple and it makes me notice it. So if you like this type of foods then it definitely is worth it to get a glimpse because it's not a bad place. I'd like it to be a different location but I'm not going to hate it I just do not like the town it's in.

My wife had the shrimp special. I also indulged on an 8oz glass of cabernet. Being our anniversary, they gifted us a well plated, lava cake, with a card signed by the staff!\n\nThe service was also great. Our waiter, Jesse/Jessie (not sure of the spelling) was very personable and knowledgeable. He checked in on us an appropriate amount of times as well. At one point, one manager asked us about our evening, which was nice.\n\nThe atmosphere is more modern with dim lit features and nice light fixtures. A couple of things that got me a bit would be the older tables that are just covered and some finishing work not being done around corners and lights. Being a fairly high-priced place to eat in the area, it also seemed weird that people in street clothes and ball caps were coming in for the bar.\n\nOverall my wife and I had a great dinner and enjoyed ourselves.

But we will say the chicken in both dishes was really tasty and juicy. Ut basically carried the dish. We were a bit surprised that shrimps and ribs were all made on the same grill. We requested to ensure no shellfish contamination was made because of allergy reasons but they weren\u2019t able to do so. Our allergy was not severe so we still ended up taking the risk and got the ribs. The soup and fries were decent. But the main star was the dessert. The white chocolate brownie was amazing and it made us want to give an extra star just for it. The place was very lively and it was hard to get the waiter\u2019s attention, which was kinda overwhelming at times. But he gave the dessert on the house since we were celebrating a special day, which was really nice!",

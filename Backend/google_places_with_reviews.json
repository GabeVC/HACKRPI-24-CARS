            "This was my third outing here and it's always a huge hit with the food. Even more so when you have awesome waiters like Javier that encourage you to dance after everyone's gone and you close down the restaurant with a private dance party. Thank you for that marvelous experience. We love coming here. Here's a picture of my delicious Wagyu Strip Steak:",
            "I had an amazing meal at the Roosevelt Room this past weekend. The spread was amazing and I was very impressed with the attention to detail that went in to every dish that graced our table.\n\nThe Filet of Atlantic Halibut was exquisite and the calamari was delicious. Our service was terrific and everything came out spot on. I would highly recommend the Roosevelt Room for anyone interested in finer dining options in the area. You will not be disappointed!",
            "We were impressed with such a fine dining experience. There were 4 of us in our party and each of our meals were delicious. The cowboy steak and filet mignon were cooked perfectly. The rack of lamb was outstanding! If you are looking for a culinary delight with exceptional service, look no further \ud83d\ude0a",
            "My husband and I ate at the Roosevelt Room last week and I haven\u2019t stopped raving about it since! First off - the atmosphere is classy and relaxed. The unique design & decor are unlike any other restaurant in the capital district; warm, inviting with hints of Italy. The staff was superb from the host to the servers, the bar staff, the chefs and the owner. They were attentive and knowledgeable of the food giving great recommendations. Watching the chefs work in the kitchen was like watching a fine tuned orchestra. Truly a pleasure to watch them in their craft. We are big \u201cfoodie\u201d people and came with high expectations after reviewing the menu online. I can genuinely say they blew us away! You will not find a menu like this ANYWHERE else I promise. They use fresh high quality products and cook it to perfection. We couldn\u2019t find a single thing that could be improved upon. Each table gets a fresh loaf of bread which in itself was delicious but I held back after 1 piece to save room. For appetizers we ordered the Red & Gold beet salad and the Spanish octopus. The owner was kind enough to send us the steak (filet mignon) tartar as well as cucumber carpaccio. The salad has a delicious dressing and the perfect mix to balance out the flavors, the octopus was tender and packed with flavor, the tartar was so chewy and delicious with the perfect sauces to compliment the flavors and the cucumber carpaccio has such a unique taste I couldn\u2019t stop going back for another taste. For our meals we both ordered the filet dinner - mine medium well, his medium. The cook was spot on for each, the potato fondant paired perfectly with the pearl onions but the sauce\u2026 the sauce had magic! I used what was left of our bread to soak it all up! The dessert menu had delicious options but unfortunately we were too full. Overall the Roosevelt Room is hands down the best place to eat in the capital district right now. We are hooked and will now be regulars. You have to try it!",
            "Enjoyed a fantastic experience, drinks and wine list reasonably priced for the selection and creativity of the drinks.  Started with the short rib dumplings, rich and bold flavor that also went  well with the brightness of the second selection of the carpaccio with foie gras mousse, both fantastic.  Their bread is warm, crusty and served with a homemade butter\u2026delicious!  We were offered an amuse bouche deviled egg topped with caviar\u2026lovely treat.\n\nDinner selections we chose were the seabass with a butternut pur\u00e9e and roasted beets and the halibut, both fish choices were cooked to perfection and the ingredients flavor showed through in every perfect bite.  You can order sides but we were so satisfied with the choices as they were and the portions were excellent, did not want to get too full.\n\nService was top notch, it\u2019s refreshing to see the owner and the chef so involved and making their rounds to see each table and ask how everything is.  Michael was kind and generous as was his talented chef.  Excellent experience and excellent menu.  I HIGHLY recommend a visit to the Roosevelt room."

            "Super tasty craft beers, beer flights and the Vegan options on the menu were all top notch. Wonderful people working hard to make sure you have an outstanding experience.",
            "This place used to be the old Troy Beirgarten very interesting decor inside with lots of love plants. Cozy area to sit, relax, eat, etc. There is a room in the back that would be wonderful in the winter to feel like you are actually outside. We ordered a few drinks at the bar they were delicious, would love to go back another time and try out the food as well",
            "I celebrated my 25th birthday here with my twin sister and group of about 10 friends and we had a blast! I had never been before but loved the atmosphere and rustic decor. It was hard to decide what drink to order because all the speciality cocktails looked good but I went with a blood orange margarita and enjoyed it very much. The drinks were a little on the pricier side, but you get what you pay for. The service was amazing and they gave me and my sister complimentary birthday shots which was very nice of them. We ordered some appetizers, including the pretzel bites and fries and they were very tasty and shareable portions. It is also in a very central location in Troy, so a perfect place to start off the night before hitting up other bars. I will definitely be back!",
            "Had an absolutely wonderful evening out. A bit louder than I expected (in my mind, it was low-key and intimate), but nonetheless we had a great time. The pizza was delishly fresh with a nice crisp on the crust, yet soft, and the wings were quite good (not the best I've had). Drinks were stiff, and their local crafts brews were plentiful (the cider donut one was A++). Will return!",
            "Dining at EMBY\u2019S Garden was great experience! The inside is beautiful and looks like the set of brunch scene in a romantic movie. Our waitress was wonderful, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu and pairing recommendations. Every time she came by our table we ended up chatting for several minutes. The food was delicious and affordable compared to other restaurants in the area. The drink menu included fun, seasonal selections with fresh ingredients. I ended up going to EMBY\u2019S Garden later  that week with some friends."

Kind of a cute place.  As for the food, the veggies with beef over rice and the tofu stew was very average, comparing to what we could get in NY and CA, but it is nice to at least be available here in Troy.  Prices were a bit higher than expected.  I also would like to suggest a lot less use of MSG!",

An indicator of a good restaurant for me is that they do not have a long menu, because it usually means they focus on quality than quantity. Everything I have ordered from them has always been delicious and hearty. I always leave the restaurant feeling content."

The portion size was pretty good for the price too.\n\nOur server was great as well. She was very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe overall atmosphere was cool with the lights hanging from the ceiling. We didn\u2019t sit outside on the patio but it appeared to have an equally cool vibe to it.",

If you're looking for a place to have a quiet dinner this is not the place as it's just bursting with energy.\n\nWe were immediately seated with the lovely staff. If you take a look around you can see the kitchen and the cooks working right in front of you which is a nice touch.\n\nWe ordered the loaded nachos as an appetizer  and the birria tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas as our entree.\n\nI feel 20 dollars for nachos is a bit steep but everything else was reasonably priced.\n\nThe food was great but I wouldn't call it the best Mexican food I've ever had. I will say though I loved the enchiladas and if I came back here that would probably be my go to order.\n\nWe didn't order any drinks but they do have a bar you can sit at if this is your thing.\n\nIf I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely be stopping by.",

But we will say the chicken in both dishes was really tasty and juicy. Ut basically carried the dish. We were a bit surprised that shrimps and ribs were all made on the same grill. We requested to ensure no shellfish contamination was made because of allergy reasons but they weren\u2019t able to do so. Our allergy was not severe so we still ended up taking the risk and got the ribs. The soup and fries were decent. But the main star was the dessert. The white chocolate brownie was amazing and it made us want to give an extra star just for it. The place was very lively and it was hard to get the waiter\u2019s attention, which was kinda overwhelming at times. But he gave the dessert on the house since we were celebrating a special day, which was really nice!",

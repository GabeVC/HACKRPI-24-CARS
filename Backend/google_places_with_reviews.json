And they are open Sundays, which was hard to find.\nEven without a reservation, we managed to get in. However, we were there early; I suspect a table might have been harder to get later on. Service was amazing! Drink refills without asking, servers checking in just the right amount, and overall great customer service.\nIt is a small pub, which means it gets loud. This was fine for us, but if you are looking for a quiet spot to have long conversations, this will not be the place you want.\nPub food and pizza seems to be their specialty. Boneless wings were very good; a medium sauce had just enough spice. Mozzarella sticks also good (great marinara!) and a decent amount of them too. The pizza was delicious! I snuck a piece of my hubby's pepperoni pizza and loved it! Homemade sauce, great crust, and a nice balance of sauce to cheese. Sandwiches we ordered were good, just not outstanding. If I go back before another show, I would honestly order some more apps and pizza (I was thinking about getting chicken tenders, but didn't. Bet they are great!).\nOverall, a solid choice if you are in the area for a show and looking for some great pub apps and pizza.",

I had a pistachio latte which was delicious. I stayed to read a book in quiet and got a comfy chair in the corner. There\u2019s an outdoor seating area which I would love to sit at during my next visit. Highly recommend!",

            "It's sad that such a nice park is being misused by some of the residents of the city that it is in. Not to mention they cannot spend any money A major overhaul of the pool that i'm sure was beautiful in his day. I think the overlooks\nshould be cleared a little bit more but it is a nice place to sit and just relax.",
            "I grew up coming here to Prospect Park for playing football, basketball, Frisbee and to cookout. The park was shuttered for a while after a certain political party basically ruined the place of public enjoyment. The roads are and we're in bad shape. I was happy to see on a chance drive by a cpl years ago, the gates were open. I come here to photograph the city in various stages of weather, time as in day or night. The deer are a plenty at 2, 3, 4 a.m. I find it cathartic and peaceful. It was the land where Samuel and Ebenezer Wilson built there home and afforded their livestock to roam and graze. Yes that Samuel 'Uncle Sam' Wilson, whose meatpacking business shipped to United States Army during War of 1812. The troops started to say The US stamped for  United States property as \"Uncle Sam\".\nI do believe that The new Mayor will do the best to get the place in shape at some point. After years of indescribable idiocy from the political party that has   mismanaged everything they touch. So the new Mayor is one of unity and common sense. In that, I have confidence to see there will be improvement here. It will give the Residents of Troy, the park that The Wilson's intended for the public.",

            "Prospect Park in Troy, New York, is a historic and well-loved green space that offers a variety of amenities and a peaceful environment. Here\u2019s a review of the park:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Panoramic Views: One of the standout features of Prospect Park is its elevation, providing stunning panoramic views of the city of Troy and the Hudson River. It's a fantastic spot for sightseeing, especially at sunset, when the landscape is bathed in golden light.\n\n2. Variety of Recreational Facilities: The park offers a wide range of recreational amenities, including tennis courts, basketball courts, and playgrounds. There\u2019s also plenty of open space for picnicking, playing catch, or simply relaxing on the grass.\n\n3. Historical Significance: Prospect Park has a rich history, being one of the oldest parks in Troy. It was designed in part by Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape architect behind Central Park. The park\u2019s historical elements, like the beautiful stone pavilion and walking paths, add to its charm.\n\n4. Well-Maintained Gardens: The park features well-tended gardens, including a rose garden that blooms beautifully in the warmer months. These areas are perfect for a leisurely stroll or for simply enjoying the floral beauty.\n\n5. Community Events: Prospect Park often hosts community events, such as outdoor concerts and festivals, which draw locals and visitors alike. These events add a vibrant and communal feel to the park, making it a focal point for the community.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Limited Parking: Parking can be challenging, particularly during peak hours or events. The park\u2019s popularity means that finding a spot might require some patience, especially on weekends.\n\n2. Aging Infrastructure: While the park is generally well-kept, some areas, such as the playground equipment and certain paths, could use updates or repairs. The age of the park is evident in some of its infrastructure.\n\n3. Seasonal Maintenance Issues: During certain times of the year, particularly in the winter, some parts of the park may not be as well-maintained, with snow or ice making paths difficult to navigate. In the summer, the park\u2019s popularity can lead to occasional littering, though it\u2019s usually addressed promptly.\n\n4. Crowds During Events: While community events are a positive aspect of the park, they can also make it very crowded, which might detract from the peaceful experience some visitors seek.",
            "Park would be a lot nicer if the city took better care of it. A lot of the roads in the park are closed, because they're falling apart. The roads that are open are in bad shape. The bathrooms have been closed for years, because they are in bad shape. They did put a few port a potties next to the closed bathrooms. There is a new disc golf course, if you're into that, and over near the tennis courts, there's some newer workout equipment. There is a nice playground for the kids, and a small splash pad. Several grills and picnic tables throughout the park as well. The park is in a beautiful spot, and has a nice view of the city, but overall, needs a lot of work to make it nice again."

            "The city of Troy, NY, made a significant investment in the golf course a couple of years ago, which resulted in huge improvements. Golfers come from miles around to play. Every time my husband & I  walk to the park on nice days, it is always busy. There are picnic areas, tennis courts & an ice rink for the local hockey players. We also enjoy getting take out from the Park Pub which is renowned for its chicken wings as well as a ham & cheese on marble rye with wholegrain mustard sandwich called  The Half & Half which is a local favorite.",
            "Frear Park's lake view is a hidden gem in the heart of the city, offering a picturesque escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. This serene spot, nestled behind the somewhat dilapidated tennis court, is a haven for nature lovers and those seeking a moment of tranquility.\n\nThe centerpiece of this scenic haven is the glistening lake, which is home to a charming community of ducks that gracefully glide across its surface. Watching these ducks is a delight, and it adds a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. As the day winds down, the lake provides a front-row seat to a breathtaking sunset, casting a warm, golden hue over the water that's simply mesmerizing.\n\nFor those who prefer not to sit idly by, there are well-placed seats along the lake's edge, inviting visitors to relax and take in the view. You can also explore the tranquil surroundings with the walking trail that meanders around the lake. This trail offers a perfect opportunity to get some exercise and immerse yourself in the natural beauty of the park.\n\nWhile the adjacent tennis court may show signs of age, it doesn't detract from the beauty of the lake view. In fact, it adds a touch of nostalgia to the experience, reminding us of the park's history.\n\nIn conclusion, Frear Park's lake view is a sanctuary of calm and beauty, where you can escape the daily grind and reconnect with nature. Watching the ducks and witnessing the sunset here is a truly magical experience. Whether you're seeking solitude or a leisurely stroll, this place has something for everyone, making it a must-visit destination for anyone in search of natural beauty in the heart of the city.",
            "I try to visit Frear Park as often as I possibly can, the park is always clean and well maintained with beautiful views and freindly people throughout. I especially like the golf course were I visit with most all of the golfers and the people who walk the trails, such a wonderful gift to the people of Troy.",
            "This was a fun little course with plenty of nice views. The greens are very very tough. They are very hilly and unpredictable. You will enjoy this place",
            "Frear Park Golf Course is in beautiful shape and condition! Greens are running fast (holes 7&8), fairways are green and fluffy and tee boxes are well cut and defined! Good job Superintendent!"

Great way to be active and it got the extra star for it's addition.",

Closer to the hospital there is a functional basketball court and some playground equipment but it's rarely used to my knowledge.  I think the main purpose of this \"park\" (more like a large patch of unused land Troy happen to mow every few weeks) is to provide shortcuts from Jacob Street to Peoples Ave without walking all the way down to 15th.\n\nThat said, this park is fairly well trafficked during daylight hours, I've never felt unsafe walking.\n\nBeman Park, and the surrounding neighborhood, is often the target of Troy Police initiatives dealing with RPI students, don't let this make you feel the park is anyway unsafe.",

There is a basketball court and a baseball field.  There is also a large Pavillion area with picnic tables that I believe can be rented.

            "Bathroom is dirty and looks like someone was living in it. My daughter stepped on glass in the sprinklers. There are several teenage brawls daily. This park was beautifully redone just for the teenagers to destroy it. Sad",

            "Kids go to school here. Enjoy the park and pool during the summer. 8 generations have enjoyed this pool. I personally have for over 47 years.",

            "Traveling from out of town and this park is great! Great place for the kiddos to get out and stretch their legs, burn some energy!",
            "This is not far from our house but I am always nervous when my kids walk anywhere by themselves and it's not because I don't trust them, I don't trust other people, let's face it, the world isn't the same as it used to be many years ago, now you have to always be on your guard, and what makes me even more nervous is the fact that an 11yr old was taken by a 16yr old from this very park, and that is extremely scary.  I mean the park and playground are very nice with lots to do, but it's always very busy. And now for me with this latest situation of the 11yr old being taken, my message to other parents, Please Please watch your children and if you aren't going to be with them make sure they have a way to check in with you!!! It's not a 100% safe world out there and you have to always be on your guard, you just never know.  Stay safe to you all."

            "With the recent trail work and clean up at the Burden Pond Environmental Park starting in May of 2019, a new life has begun at the park. New, maintained and well marked trails are found here now and accessible during all four seasons! Great Improvement to the once decrepit park",
            "The falls are beautiful but I had a lot of trouble finding it. Turns out you have to drive a little further down the road, past where maps tells you to stop. If you go through the woods a little you can walk in and around the falls.",

The splash pad is amazing for the kids. I would highly recommend checking out this summer! The kids use old plastic coffee tubs as buckets (plastic ones break). Kids always have a blast!",
